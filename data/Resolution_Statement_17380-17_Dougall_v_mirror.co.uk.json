    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution Statement 17380-17 Dougall v mirror.co.uk\n1. Sabrina Dougall complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that mirror.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Cocaine- taking Brits risk\nfaces rotting away as ruthless gangs blend drug with de-wormer that can cause\n‘HIV-like symptoms’” published on 7 August 2017.\n2. The article reported that a report claimed that a large\nquantity of cocaine in the UK had been “cut” with levamisole, which is normally\nused as an animal de-wormer. The article stated that levamisole can cause\nsevere physical side effects in humans, including skin lesions and skin\nrotting. The article also included images of sufferers displaying these\nsymptoms.\n3. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate,\nas there have not been any studies conducted into the prevalence of levamisole\nin UK cocaine. The complainant said that the reports referenced in the article\nrelated to the quality of cocaine in the US and were published in 2015. The complainant also said that the images\nincluded in the article were misleading, as it suggested the individual’s\npictured were British.\n4. The publication did not accept that it had breached the\nEditors’ Code. The publication said that the article had been provided by a\nnews agency which relied on various sources to substantiate the claims made in\nthe article. The publication noted that the reports relied on in the article\nmade reference to the increasing levels of levamisole in Europe and stated that\nin 2014 a UK government minister had been reported as stating around 80% of UK cocaine contained levamisole.\nRelevant Code provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and-where\nappropriate- an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nMediated outcome\n6. The\ncomplaint was not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties.\nIPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter.\n7. Following IPSO’s intervention, the publication offered to\npublish the following clarification as a footnote to the article:\nWe have been asked to make clear that the studies referred\nto in the article above, which was supplied by a news agency were published in\n2015 and related to cocaine found in the US rather than the UK.\n8. The complainant said that this resolved the matter to her\nsatisfaction.\n9. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 06/08/2017Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 04/09/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
