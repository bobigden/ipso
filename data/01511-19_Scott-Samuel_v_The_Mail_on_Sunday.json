Alex\nScott-Samuel complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nThe Mail on Sunday breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “CORBYN'S SECRET LINK TO PREGNANT JEWISH MP'S\nTORMENTOR”, published on 17 February 2019.\n2. The article,\nwhich appeared on the front page and continued on page 2, reported that “the\nanti-Semitism storm engulfing Jeremy Corbyn” had deepened, after Mr Corbyn “was\nlinked to the official at the centre of allegations about the racist bullying\nof a pregnant Labour MP”. It said that the publication could “reveal previously\nundisclosed links between Mr Corbyn and Alex Scott-Samuel, who has led the\ndrive to force out [the MP]”. The article said that the complainant had “even\nmet the Labour leader to discuss what he considered the ‘victimisation’ of\nanti-Zionist Corbynistas like himself”.\n3. The article went\non to report that the Labour MP it referred to had “fought off a constituency\nmotion of no confidence” which had been “approved” by the complainant, who was\nthe chairman of her constituency party, “on the grounds that her campaign\nagainst anti-Semitism amounted to ‘disloyalty’ to Mr Corbyn”. It said that the\ncomplainant met with Mr Corbyn in 2016 “over what he claimed was the\n‘victimisation of anti-Zionists’ in the party”, and that he had been given a\n“centre-stage position” during the leader’s speech at the 2018 Party\nConference. The article said that Mr Corbyn was photographed “warmly greeting”\nthe complainant following his speech.\n4. The article said\nthat the complainant had regularly appeared on an online show “aired on\nconspiracy theorist David Icke’s website”, where he had aired “controversial\nviews”, including “blaming the 9/11 terror attacks on the UK, America and\nIsrael and saying the wealthy Jewish Rothschild family were ‘behind a lot of\nthe neo-liberal influence’ in the UK”. It said that the complainant had\ndefended his “decision to approve a no-confidence motion” against the MP, “on\nthe grounds that he is ‘himself Jewish’ adding that any suggestion the local\nexecutive is ‘party to bullying and anti-Semitism is a slanderous accusation’”.\nThe article quoted the complainant as saying that he was “’hurt and offended by\nthe allegations…that I am anti-Semitic or a conspiracy theorist’”.\n5. The article also\nappeared online on 16 February 2019 in substantially the same format, under the\nheadline “Revealed: Jeremy Corbyn’s secret link to the tormentor of pregnant\nJewish MP [name]”.\n6. The complainant\nsaid that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy). He said\nthat he had no “secret link” to Jeremy Corbyn, and that he had never\n“tormented” the Labour MP. He said that he had not “led the drive to force out”\nthe MP, but had merely, as chair of her Constituency Labour Party, processed\ntwo motions which were critical of her. The complainant denied that he had\npersonally approved these motions – they had been approved by the full\nExecutive of the Constituency Labour Party (CLP) because they were properly submitted;\nthe Executive had no choice other than to approve properly submitted motions.\nHe said that he had not been named or referred to in these motions, and nor was\nhe involved in their submission. He said that he had only met Mr Corbyn\nbriefly, for three minutes, at a public meeting, when he had discussed the\nvictimisation of anti-Zionists in the party, and that Mr Corbyn had shaken\nhands with everyone on the front row of the platform after his speech; he had\nnot been given any special treatment.\n7. The complainant also said that he was not\noffered any opportunity to respond to the allegations made in the article prior\nto publication: the statement included in the article had been taken from his\nTwitter feed.\n8. The publication\ndenied any breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy). It said that it was reasonable to\ndescribe the complainant as the MP’s “tormentor” because he was chair of the\nCLP which had been accused of bullying her– including by the party’s deputy\nleader, who had explicitly referred to the motions against the MP in making\nthis accusation, and stated that “the meeting to hear it should never have been\nscheduled”. It also said that the MP had herself referred to the motions in her\nresignation letter, written after the article was published, and noted that the\ncomplainant had been one of the two signatories to a media release responding\nto criticism of the motions on behalf of the CLP. The publication said that its\narticle had not stated that the complainant had submitted the motions, but that\nhe had approved them; it said it was clear that he had done nothing to prevent\nthem, contrary to the preferences expressed by senior Labour figures. He could\ntherefore also be considered to have “led” the drive to remove the MP, as the\nindividual responsible for the actions of the local party.\n9. In support of\nthis position, the publication provided a letter from the CLP Executive to the\nMP criticising her for signing a letter which was critical of Jeremy Corbyn’s\nBrexit position. The publication also said the complainant had been among those\nwho tried to stop the MP’s campaign for the party to adopt the full IHRA\ndefinition of antisemitism, and had proposed a motion to the annual Party\nConference to this effect; it also said that the complainant had posted several\ntimes on social media suggesting that allegations of antisemitism in the Labour\nParty had been exaggerated, which could be perceived as an attack on the MP,\nwho had campaigned on the issue. The publication also provided a letter, signed\nby the complainant, in which the MP was asked to pledge her support for Mr\nCorbyn by a given date. It also said that the journalist had spoken to members\nof the CLP and sources close to the MP, who had told him of their belief that\nthe complainant was at the forefront of attacks on the MP. The publication\ndescribed sources’ accounts of a CLP meeting at which the MP had been “almost\nreduced to tears” by members’ conduct; the sources had said that the MP had\nbeen “appalled” by the complainant’s failure to intervene.\n10. The publication said that the complainant had confirmed\nand had tweeted about the fact that he did meet with Mr Corbyn in 2016, and had\ndiscussed, as reported, the “victimisation of anti-Zionists”; it said it was\nnot misleading to describe this link as “secret” where it had not previously\nbeen revealed and where the complainant had since deleted the relevant tweet.\nIt said it was also correct to say that the complainant had been seated in a\nprime position during Mr Corbyn’s conference speech, and that Mr Corbyn had\ngreeted him warmly following this speech.\n11. The publication said that a journalist had contacted the\ncomplainant prior to publication, by phone, but had received no response; the\njournalist had then sent him a text message which had been delivered\nsuccessfully on 15 February – the day before online publication. The\ncomplainant had then published a statement on Twitter on 16 February, prior to\npublication, and had emailed the journalist to inform him of this statement.\nThe publication said that the journalist had previously emailed the\ncomplainant, earlier in the week, to ask for comments on the allegation that he\nwas involved in bullying the MP; the complainant had not replied.\n12. The publication provided the text of the complainant’s\nstatement issued on Twitter, which had related to “allegations in the media\nthat [he was] anti-Semitic or a conspiracy theorist”; it addressed his link to\nthe online show, and to criticisms made of him about “references to an article\nI read on the history of neoliberalism”.\n13. The publication also provided a copy of the text message\nthe journalist sent to the complainant, prior to publication. The message asked\nfor the complainant’s comment in relation to him having tweeted a photo of\nhimself meeting Jeremy Corbyn to discuss the “’victimisation of\nanti-Zionists’”. The publication said that, irrespective of whether this\nmessage had relayed all the points covered by the article, it was clear that the\ncomplainant had been offered an opportunity to discuss the allegations with the\njournalist, but had declined to do so. It said that the complainant had also\npreviously responded to the claims relating to the CLP itself, in a media\nrelease signed by him on its behalf, and this release had been quoted in the\narticle.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n14. It was not in dispute that, under the complainant’s\nstewardship, the CLP Executive had accepted the two no-confidence motions for\ndiscussion at an upcoming meeting, and that he had subsequently defended the\ndecision to allow these motions to be put to the meeting. The complainant had\nnot suggested that he had expressed any opposition to the motions being tabled,\nor taken any steps to prevent this from happening. The publication had also\nprovided evidence that the complainant had personally requested a ‘loyalty\npledge’ from the MP, in the weeks before this meeting, and that he had\nprominently taken a different stance to the MP in relation to antisemitism\nallegations within the Labour Party. In these circumstances, and given the\ncomplainant’s overall responsibility for the local party, which it was not in\ndispute had been accused of ‘bullying’ the MP, the Committee considered that\nthe publication had taken sufficient care over its characterisation of the\ncomplainant as the MP’s “tormentor”, and over the claim that he had “led” the\n“drive to force out [the MP]”. Given his responsibility for the actions of the\nlocal party, and his personal involvement in writing to the MP to request a\npledge of loyalty, these claims did not give rise to any significantly\nmisleading impression of the complainant’s actions that would require\ncorrection. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point, and where no\nsignificantly misleading impression had been created, the decision not to put\nthese allegations to the complainant did not represent a breach of the Code.\n15. It was not misleading for the article to refer to a\n“secret link” between the complainant and Jeremy Corbyn, where it had set out\nthe substance of a connection which it said had been previously unreported, and\nwhere the complainant had deleted his tweet referring to this meeting. There\nwas also no inaccuracy requiring correction with respect to the article’s\naccount of the complainant’s “meeting” with Mr Corbyn: it was not in dispute that\nhe had shaken hands with Mr Corbyn, following an appearance on the front row of\nthe Conference platform, and had met with him to discuss the alleged\nvictimisation of anti-Zionists in the Labour Party, albeit briefly. There was\nno breach of Clause 1 on either of these points.\nConclusions\n16. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial action required\n17. N/A\nDate complaint received: 18/02/2019\nDate decision issued: 15/05/2019 \nReview\nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
