Representatives\nof Sophia Murray complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\nthat the Daily Mail breached Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause 3 (Harassment) and\nClause 6 (Children) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined\n“Mini Miss Murray, our new bawl girl!”, published 29  June 2016.\n2. The article\nreported that Andy and Kim Murray’s four-month-old daughter, the complainant,\nhad attended the Wimbledon tennis tournament for the first time. It was\naccompanied by two images of the complainant. One depicted Kim Murray pushing\nthe complainant in a pram. The second image was a cropped version of the first\nimage, such that the complainant was its only subject, and dominated the frame.\nIn this image, the complainant was lying in a pram, such that her head was\ndepicted at a low angle; her forehead, nose and one eye were visible. While the\narticle appeared on page 5, the cropped image was published as the main image\non the front page of the newspaper, with the headline: “New bawls please…it’s\nlittle Miss Murray”. The article reported that the complainant “spent her\nfather’s match…snuggled up in the players’ complex creche”.\n3. The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that the taking of a photograph of the\ncomplainant in a pram, without the knowledge or consent of her parents, and\npublication of the photograph in a national newspaper, was an intrusion into\nthe complainant’s private and family life. They said that Mrs Murray was\nattending Wimbledon to support her husband, and that in order for her to most\nappropriately care for the complainant, as a nursing mother, she needed to take\nher young daughter with her.  The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that the newspaper’s actions interfered with\nthe complainant’s right to be cared for in the manner deemed most appropriate\nby her parents, without being subject to photography, and that as a consequence\nof the photograph being published, arrangements were made for the complainant\nto be looked after at home, which disrupted her feeding arrangements.\n4. The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that images of the complainant have not been\nreleased by her parents, who had made it clear to the newspaper that their\nclients objected to photographs of the complainant being taken and published. \n5. The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that the dissemination of a child’s\notherwise unpublished image, against the express wishes of her parents, was\nlikely to cause harm and distress. In addition, they said that publication of\nsuch material creates a market for intrusive photographs of their client, and\nencourages harassing conduct by paparazzi photographers. They said that when\nthe complainant and her mother arrived and left Wimbledon that day, they were\njostled and pushed by a group of unknown photographers. They said that in these\ncircumstances, the taking and publication of the photographs constituted\nharassment.\n6. The newspaper\nsaid that the complainant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in\nthe circumstances in which the photographs were taken. It said that the\ncomplainant and her mother were arriving at one of the highest profile sporting\nevents of the year via Gate 16, an entrance to the All England Club used by\nmembers of the media, players, and officials. It said that it was a pedestrian\nentrance, overlooked by an area which is designated for photographers to take\npictures. The newspaper said that the complainant’s mother had been\nphotographed arriving at Wimbledon via Gate 16 in previous years, and provided\nimages of Venus Williams, Sir Cliff Richard and the complainant’s father\narriving via this gate in the 40 minutes before the complainant and her mother\narrived. The newspaper noted that the Wimbledon conditions of entry state that\nduring the tournament, photography takes place in the Grounds, and that “by\nyour presence at The Championships, you grant your permission, free of charge,\nfor your image …to be included in pictures”.\n7. The newspaper\nsaid that the photographer could not have known that the complainant was on her\nway to the crèche, but that this did not render her arrival at the grounds a\nprivate activity. It said that the complainant did not have a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in places where photographers may be expected to be present,\nand the complainant’s mother had chosen to place the complainant in a situation\nin which it was plainly to be expected that they would be photographed. The\nnewspaper said that the photograph did not engage any issue involving Sophia\nMurray’s welfare, nor did it reveal anything private about the child. The\nnewspaper said that there were other gates at Wimbledon through which VIPs may\nenter the ground, including one where they can drive through without being\nphotographed. It said that had the complainant’s parents wished to take steps\nto avoid her being photographed, they could have done so. \n8. The newspaper\nsaid that the photographer who took the photograph was accredited to the\nWimbledon Tournament, and was standing in a position photographers are\npermitted to be. It said that the photographer had no prior knowledge of the\ncomplainant’s arrival. It said that during the incident, the photographer did\nnot change position, and maintained a distance of approximately 50m from the\ngate. The newspaper said that the Wimbledon’s Photographer Liaison Office had\nreviewed a complaint from the complainant, and confirmed they had no concerns\nabout the conduct of the photographer. The newspaper denied that any journalist\nworking for or on behalf of the newspaper had engaged in harassment,\nintimidation or persistent pursuit of the complainant.\n9. The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that before the photograph was taken, and in\nresponse to Kim Murray’s concern that her daughter not be photographed,\nWimbledon had specifically suggested that they use Gate 16 as it would be quiet\nand free from problems. The complainant’s representatives said that Gate 16 is\ndescribed by Wimbledon as a “private and contractors” entrance, and said that\nthe photographer was not in an approved position. They said it was flawed to\nsuggest that the complainant’s parents are required to go to extraordinary\nlengths to avoid the complainant being photographed, and said that relatives of\nplayers and other VIPs are not in fact permitted to be driven within the\ngrounds.\nRelevant Code Provisions10. Clause 2 (Privacy) \ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life,\nhome, health and correspondence, including digital communications.\nii) Editors\nwill be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without\nconsent.

Whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy is highly sensitive to the facts of a case. In this instance, the\ncomplainant was a very young child. She could not be described as a public\nfigure, and neither had her parents sought publicity for her. In addition, she\nwas, at the time she was photographed, being taken by her mother, in a pram, to\nthe Wimbledon crèche. The complainant’s representatives explained that, as a\nconsequence of the publication of the photograph under complaint, the\ncomplainant’s mother had made the decision that those childcare arrangements\nhad to be changed. All these factors supported the complainant’s\nrepresentative’s position that the complainant had enjoyed a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in relation to the taking and publication of the\nphotograph.\n12. At the same time, the complainant was being taken by her\nmother through a press entrance to Wimbledon; a major sporting event where\nthere would inevitably be a very large number of spectators and photographers.\nWhile the gate used by the complainant was not a ticket-holders’ entrance, it\nwas accepted that it was a public location, and it appeared that photographers\nwere allowed to stand in a position overlooking the gate. Photographers had\ntaken photographs of the complainant’s mother and other well-known individuals\nentering via this gate in previous years, and the Committee noted that the\nphotographer who took the photographs subject to this complaint had taken a\nnumber of other photographs of people entering via this gate on the same\nmorning; there was no suggestion that the photographer had targeted, or\nsought-out the complainant.\n13. At the time of the photography, the complainant was\nsimply being pushed in a pram, and while the Committee accepted that this\nshowed her engaged in a family activity relating to her care, that activity was\nrelatively unremarkable. Furthermore, as a result of the complainant’s age, and\nthe fact that her face was only partially visible, the Committee did not\nconsider that the complainant was recognisable from the photograph published by\nthe newspaper, or that it disclosed any identifying or private information\nabout her.\n14. Having regard for all these factors, the Committee\nconcluded that the nature of the photograph and circumstances and location in\nwhich it was taken meant that the complainant did not, at that time, enjoy a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. As such, neither the taking nor publication\nof the photograph breached Clause 2. The Committee emphasised that this finding\nwas highly specific to the circumstances of this case, and particularly the\nfact that these photographs were taken within the grounds of Wimbledon during\nThe Championships.\n15. The photographs subject to this complaint were taken\nwithout the knowledge of the complainant’s mother, and there was therefore no\nsuggestion that the photographer had continued to photograph the complainant\nafter being asked to desist, or that the photographer’s behaviour had otherwise\nharassed the complainant.\n16. The Committee did not consider that the act of\npublication of the photograph, in the circumstances, constituted harassment\nunder the terms of Clause 3. Clause 3 generally relates to the conduct of\njournalists in the news gathering process; publication of information would\nonly represent a course of conduct such as to represent harassment under the\nterms of Clause 3 in exceptional circumstances. The Committee did not consider\nthat the newspaper’s publication of the photograph was such a case, and this\naspect of the complaint did not raise a breach of Clause 3.\n17. The information the photographs contained about the\ncomplainant, her arrival at Wimbledon, or being pushed in a pram on her way to\nthe Wimbledon crèche were not issues involving her welfare, such that consent\nfor the photograph from a parent was required under Clause 6 (iii). The\nCommittee did not establish that the newspaper had published details of the\ncomplainant’s private life, such as to require justification. As such, there\nwas no breach of Clause 6 (v). There was no breach of Clause 6.\nConclusions\n18. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial action required\n19. N/A\nReceived: 29/06/2016Concluded:  28/10/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
