Therefore, the adjudication should also be published on the publication’s website, with a link to the full adjudication (including the headline) appearing in the top 50% of stories on the publication’s website for 24 hours; it should then be archived in the usual way. If the newspaper intends to continue to publish the online article without amendment to remove the breach identified by the Committee, the full text of the adjudication should also be published on the article, beneath the headline. If amended to remove the breach, a link to the adjudication should be published with the article, explaining that it was the subject of an IPSO adjudication, and explaining the amendments that have been made. The publication should contact IPSO to confirm the amendments it now intends to make to the online material to avoid the continued publication of material in breach of the Editors’ Code of Practice. The headline to the adjudication should make clear that IPSO has upheld the complaint, give the title of the publication and refer to the complaint’s subject matter. The headline must be agreed with IPSO in advance. The terms of the adjudication for publication are as follows: Christine Sharp complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that mirror.co.uk breached Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3 (Harassment) and Clause 9 (Reporting of crime) in an article headlined “Serial stalker who boasted about fictional 'wild sex life' ruined couple's lives” published 18 July 2019. The article reported on the sentencing of the complainant’s daughter after her conviction for a criminal offence. The article included a photograph which was captioned “[the complainant's daughter] is led away by police after being arrested in 2017\". In the photograph the complainant was visible in the background, standing and looking out of a doorway of a house as the arrest was taking place. The complainant said that the article breached Clause 9 as she was identified as a relative of someone convicted of crime in the published photograph in circumstances where she was not genuinely relevant to the story. She said readers would assume her identity as a relative given that her and her daughter were both pictured at the entrance to the family home. The publication maintained that the complainant was not identified as the friend or relative of someone accused or convicted of crime as she was not named in the article and her relationship to her daughter was not explicitly mentioned. IPSO considered that readers of the article would have inferred that the arrest was taking place at the home of the person being arrested and it was likely that readers would have assumed that the complainant was also a resident at the address. It also concluded that readers would have assumed that the complainant was likely to be a relative on the person being arrested, given that the article noted that the person being arrested “lives with her mum and dad in Airdrie”. Whilst the complainant had not been named in the article, the Committee concluded that the information contained in the photograph itself, taken together with the information reported in the text of the article, identified the complainant as a relative or friend of the individual who was being arrested and who had later been convicted of a crime, as reported in the article. Where there was no basis for a finding that the complainant was genuinely relevant to the story at the time of publication, there was a breach of Clause 9.   Date complaint received: 03/07/2020",

Christine Sharp complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that mirror.co.uk breached Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3\n(Harassment) and Clause 9 (Reporting of crime) in an article headlined “Serial\nstalker who boasted about fictional 'wild sex life' ruined couple's lives”\npublished 18 July 2019.\n2. The article reported on the sentencing of the\ncomplainant’s daughter, who had been convicted of a criminal offence. It noted\nthat the complainant’s daughter “lives with her mum and dad in Airdrie”. The\narticle also included a photograph which was captioned “[the complainant's\ndaughter] is led away by police after being arrested in 2017\". In the\nphotograph the complainant was visible in the background, standing and looking\nout of a doorway of a house. The house was the home of the complainant, where\nher daughter was living at the time of her arrest. The photograph also showed\npart of a plaque on the exterior wall of the house, which included the name of\nthe road and the family’s name, although the name of the road was partly\nobscured. The text of the article did not name the complainant.\n3. The complainant said the article breached Clause 9 as the\nphotograph identified her as a relative of a person accused and convicted of\ncrime, namely her daughter. Whilst she was not named in the article or\nphotograph caption, the complainant considered that readers would assume her\nidentity as a relative given that her and her daughter were both pictured at\nthe entrance to the family home. The complainant also said the article breached\nClause 2 as it contained a photograph of her likeness and address plaque. The\nplaque was partially obscured but showed the family name: ‘Sharp’. The\ncomplainant said that the photograph had been taken without her knowledge and\nconsent whilst her daughter was being arrested. She said she had come to the\nfront door in order to comfort her daughter but remained within the house. She\nhad been distressed by the situation, the policemen searching her home and the\nlarge crowd gathered on the street. Only later did the complainant realise\nthere was a photographer outside the property. The complainant said that the\npublication of the article breached Clause 3 and had led to harassment from\nmembers of the public.\n4. The publication did not accept it had breached the Code.\nIn respect of the complaint under Clause 9, it accepted that the complainant\nwas not genuinely relevant to the story, but it pointed to the fact that the\ncomplainant was not identified by name in the article. It also pointed out that\nthe complainant had identified herself as a relative of her daughter by sharing\nher daughter’s Facebook post about a previous IPSO ruling on her own public\nFacebook page in May 2020. It also said it understood that the complainant visited\nthe court on two occasions during her daughter’s trial and waited for her in\nthe court café.\n5. The publication denied any breach of Clause 2. It noted\nthat the address plaque was obscured in the photograph. In any event, it said\nthat an address is not generally private information and, in this case, was\nalready in the public domain as the registered address of the complainant’s\ndaughter’s company. It stated that the photograph had first been published in\nMarch 2019, albeit with the complainant cropped out; and first published with\nthe complainant visible in a print article of 17 July 2019. Further, it stated\nthat the delay in the complaint being made indicated that there was limited\nintrusion within the meaning of Clause 2. Finally, the publication emphasised\nthat the complainant could have been viewed by any passer-by such as those in\nthe crowd which had gathered outside the property at the time of the arrest and\nmaintained that no private information was disclosed in the photograph as it\nonly revealed the complainant’s likeness. The newspaper pixilated the\ncomplainant’s face and the address plaque upon receipt of the complaint. The\npublication said that Clause 3 was not engaged, as the complainant’s concern\ndid not relate to approaches from journalists, which the Clause covers.\n6. In response, the complainant said that she had posted\npublicly on Facebook about a previous IPSO ruling relating to her daughter only\nafter that ruling was in the public domain, and 10 months after the article under\ncomplaint was published. In addition, whilst she accepted that she had visited\nthe court café once at the time her daughter’s trial and waited for her\ndaughter, she said she did not enter the courtroom itself, did not arrive with\nher daughter and had initially visited the court building in relation to other\nbusiness.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 2 (Privacy)*\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\n8. Clause 3 (Harassment)*\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\niii)  Editors must\nensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care\nnot to use non-compliant material from other sources.\n9. Clause 9 (Reporting of crime)*\ni) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of\ncrime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they are\ngenuinely relevant to the story.\nFindings of the Committee\n10. The first consideration under Clause 9 is whether the\ncomplainant was identified as the friend or relative of someone accused or\nconvicted of crime. The Committee considered that readers of the article would\nhave inferred that the arrest was taking place at the home of the person being\narrested due to her surname being visible on the address plaque and the\nresidential nature of the property. It was likely that readers would have\nassumed that the complainant was also a resident at the property given that she\nwas not wearing outdoor clothing and was standing inside the house at the time\nthe photograph was taken. The Committee noted that the article reported that\nthe person being arrested “lives with her mum and dad in Airdrie” and thus\nreaders would have inferred that the complainant was likely the “mum” of the\nperson arrested. Whilst the complainant had not been named in the article, the\nCommittee concluded that the information contained in the photograph itself,\ntaken together with the information reported in the text of the article,\nidentified the complainant as a relative or friend of the individual who was\nbeing arrested and who had later been convicted of a crime, as reported in the\narticle. \n11. The Committee noted that the publication had accepted\nthat the complainant was not genuinely relevant to the story. Further, the\ncomplainant’s public comments about an IPSO ruling relating to her daughter\nwere made subsequently and therefore did not provide a basis for a finding that\nshe was genuinely relevant to the story at the time of publication. There was a\nbreach of Clause 9.\n12. The Committee next considered whether the photograph\nrelated to the complainant’s private life such that its publication engaged the\nterms of Clause 2. The complainant was standing inside the doorway of her home\nwhen the photograph was taken and, in these circumstances, Clause 2 was\nengaged. The Committee then turned to the question of whether the complainant\nhad a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the information\ncontained in the photograph. The published photograph had revealed the complainant’s\nlikeness, and this was information which could be seen by the members of the\npublic who had gathered outside the property at the time the photograph was\ntaken. The Committee noted that the photograph, in conjunction with the text of\nthe article, had identified the complainant as a relative or friend of the\nsubject of the article. However, a familial connection or friendship is not\ngenerally information in respect of which an individual has a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. In these circumstances, the Committee found that the\ncomplainant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in respect of the\ninformation about her which was contained in the photograph and there was no\nintrusion into the complainant's private life by its publication. There was no\nbreach of Clause 2.\n13. The complainant said that the publication of the\nphotograph had also breached Clause 2 by revealing her address. The Committee\nnoted that someone’s address is not generally private information. Moreover,\nthe complainant’s full address was not visible in the image as it was obscured.\nThere was no breach of Clause 2 on this point.\n14. The complainant was concerned that the article had led\nto harassment from members of the public. Clause 3 generally relates to the way\njournalists behave when researching a news story and is meant to protect people\nfrom being repeatedly approached by the press against their wishes. Where the\ncomplainant did not argue that the alleged approaches were made by people\nworking for the newspaper, and where there was no evidence of this having\noccurred, the terms of Clause 3 were not engaged.\nConclusions\n15. The complaint was upheld under Clause 9.\nRemedial Action Required\n16. Having upheld the complaint, the Committee considered\nwhat remedial action should be required. In circumstances where the newspaper\nhad breached Clause 9, the publication of an adjudication was appropriate.\n17. The complaint related to material published in an online\narticle. Therefore, the adjudication should also be published on the\npublication’s website, with a link to the full adjudication (including the\nheadline) appearing in the top 50% of stories on the publication’s website for\n24 hours; it should then be archived in the usual way. If the newspaper intends\nto continue to publish the online article without amendment to remove the\nbreach identified by the Committee, the full text of the adjudication should\nalso be published on the article, beneath the headline. If amended to remove\nthe breach, a link to the adjudication should be published with the article,\nexplaining that it was the subject of an IPSO adjudication, and explaining the\namendments that have been made. The publication should contact IPSO to confirm\nthe amendments it now intends to make to the online material to avoid the\ncontinued publication of material in breach of the Editors’ Code of Practice.\nThe headline to the adjudication should make clear that IPSO has upheld the\ncomplaint, give the title of the publication and refer to the complaint’s\nsubject matter. The headline must be agreed with IPSO in advance. The terms of\nthe adjudication for publication are as follows:\nChristine Sharp complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that mirror.co.uk breached Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3\n(Harassment) and Clause 9 (Reporting of crime) in an article headlined “Serial\nstalker who boasted about fictional 'wild sex life' ruined couple's lives”\npublished 18 July 2019.\nThe article reported on the sentencing of the complainant’s\ndaughter after her conviction for a criminal offence.
