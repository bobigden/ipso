Amanda Wilson\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that thesun.co.uk\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2 (Privacy) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “JINGLE BRAWLS Christmas party season gets\nmessy with bloodsoaked boozers carted off in ambulances”, published on 9\nDecember 2018.2. The article was\na photo gallery which showed people attending Christmas parties in Newcastle.\nIt featured two photographs of the complainant, one of which was the first\nphoto in the article under the headline. The complainant was pictured with\nblood on her face.3. The complainant\nsaid that the article gave the misleading impression that she was involved in a\n“brawl” and was a “boozer”. She said that she had been attacked at random, was\nnot drunk, and was in no way culpable for the injury she had sustained. She\nsaid that the impression given by this headline had greatly added to her\ndistress at a difficult time.4. The complainant\nsaid that the photographs were taken without her consent and knowledge, in\nbreach of Clause 2 (Privacy). She said that the publication of these images\ncaused her friends and family much concern, as many were unaware of the extent\nof her injuries prior to photographs appearing online.5. The publication\ndid not accept that the headline gave the misleading impression that the\ncomplainant was the originator of any violence, and said that it was simply a\npun on the song “Jingle Bells”.6. The publication\nsaid that the photographs were taken in a public place in which the complainant\ndid not have any reasonable expectation of privacy; in these circumstances\nthere was no obligation to ask for permission or inform the subjects of the\nphotographs prior to publication. However, the publication said that there was\nno intent to cause any distress in publishing the photographs, and removed the\narticle in question on receipt of the complaint. Relevant Code Provisions1. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Clause 2 (Privacy)i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.Mediated outcome7. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.8. During IPSO’s\ninvestigation, the publication offered to send the complainant a private letter\nof apology which made clear that any reference to a “brawl” was in no way\nintended to suggest that the complainant had been involved in a fight or\naltercation.9. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to her satisfaction.10. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 11/12/2018Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 31/01/2019\n \n \n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
