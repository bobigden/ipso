Neil Robinson complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Swindon Advertiser breached Clause 1 (Accuracy)\nof the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Career in RAF left\ntarnished”, published on 14 March 2015. \n2. The article reported that the complainant appeared at\nSwindon Magistrates’ Court on charges of stalking and harassment. The article\nwas sub headlined: “Ex-partner was stalked after split”. \n3. The complainant said that he had not been charged with\nstalking, and that the article was therefore inaccurate. He said that at the\nstart of the court proceedings, the Clerks of the Court made clear that the\ncharge sheet had been inaccurate, which was affirmed by the Magistrate and by\nthe prosecution. The complainant brought the inaccuracy to the newspaper’s\nattention on the day the article was published. The complainant said that the\nnewspaper’s subsequent correction and amendments did not adequately deal with\nwhat was a significant inaccuracy. \n4. The newspaper provided a copy of the court list which\nhad been circulated electronically, and was available in court on the day. It\nstated that the complainant had been charged with stalking without\nfear/alarm/distress contrary to 2A (1) and (4) of the Protection from\nHarassment Act 1997. The newspaper said that a reporter had been in court for\nthe full duration of the proceedings. It provided a copy of the reporter’s\nshorthand notes from the court hearing, and said that he did not hear any\ndiscussion about an amendment to charges.  However, the newspaper did not\ndispute that the complainant was charged with harassment, rather than\nharassment with stalking.  It said that to the extent that the article\nreported the complainant’s charge inaccurately, it was not the fault of the\nnewspaper. \n5. The print article had appeared on page 10 of the 14\nMarch edition of the newspaper, and there had been a cross reference to the\narticle on page 8 which stated “RAF man turned stalker: P10”. After being\ncontacted by the complainant, the newspaper published a clarification on page 3\nof the 16 March edition. The clarification explained that the article had\nquoted the charge against the complainant as “stalking and harassment”. It said\nthat the CPS had amended the charge to one of harassment, and made clear that\nthe complainant was not convicted of stalking. After the complainant contacted\nthe newspaper, the online article was amended to remove the claim that Mr\nRobinson had been charged for stalking, and to include the positive comments\nmade during the court proceedings by the complainant’s RAF officer, who had\nbeen a character witness. The newspaper also published the clarification on its\nwebsite, and apologised privately to the complainant. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving the\nRegulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance. \niii) The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nFindings of the Committee\n7. The newspaper demonstrated that it had taken steps to\nensure the accuracy of the article: its reporter had attended the proceedings;\ntaken detailed shorthand notes; and reported the cited charge on a document\nthat had been provided by the Court. Although the Committee was not able to\ndetermine the precise series of events relating to the change to the charge, it\ndid establish that there was no breach of Clause 1 (i). \n8. Nevertheless, it was inaccurate to report that the\ncomplainant had been charged with stalking and harassment. Once the newspaper\nhad recognised this inaccuracy, it published a correction with greater\nprominence than the article under complaint. The correction was published\npromptly; noted the nature of the inaccuracy; and made clear that the charge\nhad been amended to one of harassment, the correct position. The newspaper\nfulfilled its obligations under Clause 1 (ii), and there was therefore no\nbreach of the Code. \nConclusions\n9. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 16/03/2015\nDate decision issued:  05/06/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
