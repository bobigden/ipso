A woman complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that the Manchester Evening News breached Clause 2 (Privacy),\nClause 6 (Children), and Clause 9 (Reporting of crime) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Both be seeing me very soon – you’re dead,\ntrust me... “, published on 30 November 2019\n2. The article reported on the conviction of a man for\nvarious violent, antisocial and sexual offences. It included photographs of the\nman.\n3. The article appeared online on 28 November 2019 with the\nheadline: 'You're dead. Trust me'... scaffolder posted nude pics of his\nex-girlfriend on Whatsapp and threatened to kill her after she complained”. It\nwas substantially the same as the print version, but included two photographs\nof the man with a young child. The child’s face was pixelated.\n4. The complainant was the mother of the child pictured in\nthe online article. She said that despite the photograph being pixelated,\nfriends and family were able to identify her child. She said that the\nidentification of her child in association with the man, in the context of a\ncourt report into several serious convictions, caused her much distress and\nrepresented a breach of Clause 2, Clause 6, and Clause 9.\n5. The publication apologised for any distress caused but\ndid not accept that there was any breach of the Code. It said that it removed\nthe photographs as soon it was contacted by the complainant, and that it was\nimportant to include the photographs to contrast the man’s crimes with his lack\nof regard for the wellbeing of the young child. It also noted that the\nphotographs had been taken from an open social media page, and the newspaper\nhad taken steps to pixelate the child’s face.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 2 (Privacy)*\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nClause 6 (Children)*\ni) All pupils should be free to complete their time at\nschool without unnecessary intrusion.\nii) They must not be approached or photographed at school\nwithout permission of the school authorities.\niii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or photographed\non issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a custodial\nparent or similarly responsible adult consents.\niv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material\ninvolving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their\nchildren or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.\nClause 9 (Reporting of Crime)*\ni) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of\ncrime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they are\ngenuinely relevant to the story.\nii) Particular regard should be paid to the potentially\nvulnerable position of children under the age of 18 who witness, or are victims\nof, crime. This should not restrict the right to report legal proceedings.\niii) Editors should generally avoid naming children under\nthe age of 18 after arrest for a criminal offence but before they appear in a\nyouth court unless they can show that the individual’s name is already in the\npublic domain, or that the individual (or, if they are under 16, a custodial\nparent or similarly responsible adult) has given their consent. This does not\nrestrict the right to name juveniles who appear in a crown court, or whose\nanonymity is lifted.\nMediated Outcome\n7. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n8. During IPSO’s investigation, as a gesture of goodwill,\nthe publication offered to write the complainant a private letter of apology.\n9. The complainant said that this would resolve her\ncomplaint.\n10. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 29/11/2019\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 29/01/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
