    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution\nStatement – 00223-22 Moore v dailyrecord.co.uk\nSummary\nof Complaint\n1. Richard\nMoore complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\ndailyrecord.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 3 (Harassment) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Outrage at claim Scots\ncouncillor called woman's assault by ex-partner 'just another domestic'”,\npublished on 17 December 2021.\n2. The\narticle, which appeared online only, reported on claims that the complainant –\na local councillor – had “sparked outrage after allegedly referring to an\nattack on a woman by her partner as \"just another domestic\"”. It went\non to state that the complainant had “allegedly made the remarks at a\nbehind-closed-doors licensing meeting on Monday, to which the public had no\naccess”, and that another councillor had released a public statement which said\nthat \"I am utterly appalled that an elected member in a council meeting\ntoday referred to a very serious assault on a female by her male ex-partner as\n' just another domestic'”.\n3. The\narticle also included a comment from the complainant, in which he said \"I\ndid not use the word 'just'. I acknowledged that it was a domestic and that it\nwas no less serious for that. Any sort of violence against any person is\nunacceptable. Violence against women is more prevalent than violence against\nmen but it counts both ways. Whichever way it goes it should be dealt with\nrobustly.\"\n4. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1, and\nthat he had not made the comments which the article alleged he had made. He\nsaid that this had been confirmed after the matter had been referred to the\nMonitoring Officer, who found that the complainant had not made this alleged comment.\nHe said that the publication would have been aware of this fact had they\ncontacted the council for comment and properly fact-checked the article prior\nto publication. To support his position on this point, the complainant provided\na statement  from the council which had\nbeen given to another media organisation, which stated the council could\nconfirm that he had not made the comment during the meeting.\n5. The\ncomplainant also said that Clause 3 had been breached, as the journalist who\nwrote the article under complaint had written numerous articles about him.\n6. The\npublication said that the information included in the article regarding the\ncomment had been provided by an anonymous source, and that this information had\nbeen supported and confirmed by several other sources. It also noted that the\ndisputed comment was presented throughout the article as an allegation – and\ntherefore distinguished from established fact – and that the article also\nincluded the complainant’s denial.\n7. Nevertheless,\ntaking into account the information the complainant had provided to IPSO –\nnamely, the statement from the council – the publication removed the online\narticle in its entirety, to resolve the complaint.\n8. The\ncomplainant said that the removal of the article was not sufficient to resolve\nhis complaint, and that he wished for the publication to publish some form of\nclarification or correction on its website.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 3\n(Harassment)\ni)\nJournalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit.\nii) They\nmust not persist in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing\nindividuals once asked to desist; nor remain on property when asked to leave\nand must not follow them. If requested, they must identify themselves and whom\nthey represent.\niii)  Editors must ensure these principles are\nobserved by those working for them and take care not to use non-compliant\nmaterial from other sources.\nMediated\nOutcome\n9. The\ncomplaint was not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties.\nIPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter.\n10.\nDuring IPSO’s investigation the publication offered to publish the following\nstandalone online correction and apology, which would appear on its homepage\nfor 24 hours and then be archived for the lifetime of the website:\nAn\narticle published by dailyrecord.co.uk on 17 December was headlined 'Outrage at\nclaim Scots councillor called woman's assault by ex-partner 'just another\ndomestic'', and originally reported that Councillor Richard Moore referred to\nthe attack as 'just another domestic'. This allegation was provided by a source\nand published in good faith, however, we have since been advised that this is\nnot true. Angus Council has confirmed that Cllr Moore did not make that\ncomment, nor was domestic abuse trivialised by any councillors at the meeting.\nWe would like to clarify this and apologise for the error.\n11. The\ncomplainant said that this would resolve the matter to his satisfaction.\n12. As\nthe complaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make\na determination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate\ncomplaint received: 05/01/2022\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 30/03/2022\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
