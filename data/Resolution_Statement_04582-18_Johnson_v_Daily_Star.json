    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nComplaint 04582-18 Johnson v Daily Star\nSummary of complaint\n1. David\nJohnson, acting on behalf of Adam Johnson, complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Daily Star breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Footie perv Adam ‘will play abroad’”,\npublished on 2 March 2018.\n2. The\ncomplainant said that it was inaccurate to refer to his son as a “paedophile”\nor a “nonce”. He said the term “paedophile” described a “male predator who had\nsexual attraction towards prepubescent children”; his son was not a paedophile.\n3. The\nnewspaper denied that it had breached the Code. It noted that Adam Johnson had\nbeen convicted of sexual activity with a child; it was not therefore inaccurate\nto use the word “paedophile” to describe him. It also did not consider that it\nwas inaccurate to describe him as a “pervert”, which referred to a person whose\nsexual behaviour is regarded as abnormal and unacceptable.\nRelevant Code provisions\n4. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nMediated outcome\n5. The\nnewspaper offered to remove the article from its website, and it agreed to\ncontact the complainant if it needed to verify information which it received\nabout Adam Johnson.\n6. The\ncomplainant accepted the newspaper’s offer as a resolution to the complaint.\n7. As the\ncomplaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 20/03/2018\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 18/07/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
