Suraj Gharu\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Telegraph.co.uk\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Levi Bellfield ‘belonged to paedophile gang who escaped justice’”\npublished on 30 December 2019.\n2. The article\nreported on a report prepared by a senior social worker. The article said that,\nin the report, the author had claimed that Levi Bellfield \"belonged to an\norganised gang of paedophiles who may still be at large\". The article\nidentified the complainant as a “friend of Bellfield” who was named in the\nreport and stated that he was “jailed for five years for having sex with a 14\nyear old who was in care at [named] children’s home”.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) because\nhe was not convicted of having sexual intercourse with a 14 year old child. In\nfact, he was convicted of inciting a 15 year old to engage in sexual activity.\nThe complainant also said that it was misleading to describe him as a friend or\nassociate of Levi Bellfield – they were not friends, and the complainant said\nthat he simply worked as a wheel-clamper for Mr Bellfield and he was not part\nof any “paedophile gang” as claimed in the article’s headline.\n4. The publication\naccepted that the complainant had not engaged in sexual intercourse with the\nchild, but said that the fact that the complainant had been convicted of\nengaging in sexual activity with a child meant that the description of the\noffence for which the complainant had been convicted  was not significantly misleading. It also\nnoted that the description was based on articles published at the time of the\ncomplainant’s conviction and noted that these remained in the public domain\nun-amended and provided these to IPSO. In relation to the age of the child, the\npublication said that this was also based on information included in articles\npublished at the time of the conviction, however, it said that the difference\nbetween the victim being 14 years old and 15 years oldwas not a significant\ninaccuracy. Nevertheless, on receipt of the complaint it amended the article to\nremove the reference to “sex” and added the following footnote correction to\nthe article:\n“CORRECTION: This article originally stated that Suraj Gharu\nwas jailed for five years for \"having sex with\" a 14-year-old girl.\nThe sentence, reduced to four years on appeal, was in fact imposed for the\ncrimes of sexual activity with a child under 16 and inciting a child under 16\nto engage in sexual activity. The article has been amended accordingly.”\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator.\niii) A fair\nopportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n6. It was not in\ndispute that the complainant had been convicted of engaging in sexual activity\nwith a 15 year old child, however, he disputed that he had been convicted of\nengaging in sexual intercourse with a child. In describing the offence for\nwhich the complainant had been convicted, the publication had relied on articles\npublished at the time of the complainant’s conviction which stated that he had\nhad “sex” with the child; as these remained unchallenged in the public domain,\nthere was no failure to take care and no breach of Clause 1(i). Following\npublication, the complainant had demonstrated that he had not been convicted\nfor having had sexual intercourse with the child, and reporting that he had\nbeen jailed for “having sex” with a child was significantly misleading and\nrequired correction to avoid a breach of Clause 1(ii). Following receipt of\ndetails of the offence for which the complainant had been convicted, the\npublication had promptly offered to publish a correction as a footnote to the\nonline article, and to amend the article, to set out the correct position. This\nproposal satisfied the requirements of Clause 1(ii) and the correction should\nnow be printed.  \n7. Reporting that\nthe complainant’s victim was 14 years old, when in fact she was 15 years old,\nwas not significantly misleading in circumstances where the complainant’s\nvictim was under the age of the consent at the time of the offence.\nNevertheless, the Committee welcomed the publication’s offer to clarify this\npoint. Where it was not in dispute that the complainant was a former employee\nof Levi Bellfield, it was not misleading for the article to describe him as a\n“friend”. The article focussed on the claim in the social worker’s report that\nMr Bellfield belonged to an organised gang of paedophiles. The headline, which\nsummarised the author’s claim that Levi Bellfield ‘belonged to a paedophile\ngang”, was not inaccurate and the text of the article had accurately explained\nthe complainant’s connection to the story. \nThere was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusion\n8. The complaint\nwas not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n9. N/A\nDate complaint received: 05/08/2019\nDate decision issued: 18/10/2019\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
