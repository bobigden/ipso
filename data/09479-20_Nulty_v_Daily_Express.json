    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision of the Complaints Committee – 09479-20 Nulty v\nDaily Express \nSummary of Complaint \n1. Craig Nulty complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that Daily Express breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’\nCode of Practice in an article headlined “European Union is sinking just like\nthe Titanic”, published on 5 June 2020. \n2. The article was an opinion piece which reported on the\nattempt to agree on a trade deal between the UK and the EU during the\ncoronavirus crisis. It finished by reporting that “it looks like World Trade\nOrganisation rules and so what? Canada and Australia trade with the EU and\nprosper without bowing and scraping. So that will do us nicely.” \n3. The article also appeared online in substantially the\nsame format under the headline “European Union is sinking just like Titanic,\nsays FREDERICK FORSYTH”. \n4. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1 because it gave the inaccurate impression that the trading\nrelationship between the EU and Australia and that between the EU and Canada\nwere the same. He noted that it was misleading to suggest that both followed\nWorld Trade Organisation rules. \n5. The publication did not accept that there had been a\nbreach of Clause 1. It said that the aim of the article was to state that a\ntrading relationship similar to either Australia, Canada or the World Trade\nOrganisation rules would work for the UK. It said that nowhere in the article\ndid it report that the Australian and Canadian models were identical. It\noffered to amend the final sentence of the article to “So either of these would\ndo us nicely” and add the following footnote correction to the online version:\nThis article has been amended to make clear that Canada and Australia trade\nwith the bloc under different and agreed rules. The publication did not offer a\nprint correction. \nRelevant Code Provisions \n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for. \niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nFindings of the Committee \n7. The sentence regarding the trade relationships between\nCanada and the EU and Australia and the EU came directly after a sentence which\nstated that the prediction was that the UK would “follow World Trade\nOrganisation rules and so what?” After describing that the UK would probably\nuse these rules and then immediately stating that “Canada and Australia trade\nwith the EU and prosper” was, on balance, misleading as it gave the misleading\nimpression that Canada and Australia traded with the EU under World Trade\nOrganisation rules. Sandwiching the references to Canada and Australia trading\nwith the EU, between reference to WTO rules, and the observation “so that will\ndo us nicely” where “that” appears to be a reference to WTO rules, reinforced\nthe suggestion that Canada and Australia trade under those rules. The\npublication had not taken care not to publish misleading information, and there\nwas a breach of Clause 1(i). \n8. In an article describing the potential trade deal between\nthe UK and the EU, this reference was significantly misleading as it gave the\nimpression that two countries followed World Trade Organisation rules which was\nnot the case. This required correction under Clause 1(ii). The publication had\noffered to publish a clarification online, however it did not adequately\nidentify the original inaccuracy, and was not offered in print, this failed to\nsatisfy Clause 1(ii) and there was a further breach. \nConclusions \n9. The complaint was upheld. \nRemedial Action Required \n10. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1, the Committee\nconsidered what remedial action should be required. In circumstances where the\nCommittee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the\npublication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of\nwhich is determined by IPSO. \n11. The Committee considered that the publication did not\ntake the necessary care to report on the trade relationship between the EU and\nAustralia and the EU and Canada. The Committee considered that the appropriate\nremedy was the publication of a correction to put the correct position on\nrecord. A correction was considered to be sufficient, as the claim was not the\ncentral point of the article. \n12. The Committee then considered the placement of the\ncorrection. It should appear as a footnote to the article online, and in the\nprint version of the paper in the established corrections and clarifications\ncolumn. It should state that it has been published following an upheld ruling\nby the Independent Press Standards Organisation. The full wording and position\nshould be agreed with IPSO in advance. \n \nDate complaint received: 15/06/2020 \nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 11/09/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
