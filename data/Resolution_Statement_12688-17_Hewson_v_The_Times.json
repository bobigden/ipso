Barbara Hewson\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The Times had\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Barrister accuses foul-mouthed colleague of online bullying”,\npublished on 30 January 2017.\n2. The article\nreported that the complainant, a human rights barrister, had been engaged in a\ndispute with another member of the profession. The article said that the\ncomplainant, “who was once described as ‘the most foul-mouthed lawyer on\nTwitter’, is in a spat with one of her counterparts in child protection, which\nhas resulted in the lawyers reporting each other to the police and regulators\nover allegations of stalking and harassment”.\n3. The complainant\ndid not accept the newspaper’s characterisation of her as the “most\nfoul-mouthed lawyer on Twitter”. She further said that she had not reported the\nother barrister featured in the article to the Bar Standards Board, or the\npolice, and that the article inaccurately asserted that it had been alleged\nthat she had harassed a journalist.\n4. The newspaper\nsought to resolve the matter through mediation.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact\nMediated Outcome\n6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.7. Following\nIPSO’s intervention, the publication offered, as a gesture of goodwill, to\nremove the contested description from the online article and\n\"foul-mouthed\" out of the online headline.
