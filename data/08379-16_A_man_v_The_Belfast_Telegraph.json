The article was also published online with the headline “Top\ngrammar school comes under fire after pupil's quotes that praise Hitler are\nincluded in yearbook”.\n2. The article reported on the complainant’s son’s entry in his school\nyearbook, which it explained was made up of short biographies of graduating\nstudents. The article claimed that the yearbook “included vile Nazi comments\nattributed to a pupil”. The article named the school, but did not name the\ncomplainant’s son. It reported that in his yearbook entry, the complainant’s\nson had described himself as “British, Loyalist and Fascist”; had quoted: “It\nis not the truth that matters, but victory”, from Adolf Hitler’s autobiography\n‘Mein Kampf’;, and had referred to the 1923 Munich Putsch.\n3. The article was accompanied by an image of the yearbook entry, in which\nthe complainant’s son’s face and name were pixelated. In the image of the\nyearbook entry, the words “Munich Putsch (1923)” appeared under “My\nconfession…”, and the quote from Mein Kampf was referred to as “Best quote”,\nand was attributed to Adolf Hitler. The image also showed that the\ncomplainant’s son had responded to the statement “In 10 years time I’ll be …”,\nwith the claim “Crushing Socialism”, and responded to the question “what will\nyou miss most?”, with “Banter in Politics”. The image showed that the complainant\nhas responded to the statement “3 words that best describe me are…”, with the\nwords “British, Loyalist, Fascist”. The article appeared on the front page, but\nthe full article was published on page 5 with the headline: “Top grammar comes\nunder fire after pupil’s quotes that praise Hitler are included in yearbook”.\n4. The article reported that the school had issued a statement saying that\nthe yearbook was a student publication, that the contribution in question was\nmade by an 18-year-old former pupil, and that his comments did not reflect the\nviews of the school. It reported that a local politician had objected to the\ncomments, and that he had demanded the yearbook be recalled, and edited. It\nreported that the comments had “sparked alarm among parents”, and that one\nparent had “accused the school of ‘nurturing’ hatred”.\n5. The online version of the article was identical to the print version.\n6. The complainant said the yearbook had been written for the students in\nhis son’s year group at school, and had not been intended for wider\ndistribution. As a result, the yearbook entries were written in a light-hearted\nmanner, containing “in-jokes”, only apparent to fellow students and some of the\nteachers. He noted that in the same yearbook, another student had described\nhimself as a “Nationalist, Communist”, quoted Karl Marx, and referred to the\nBolshevik Revolution, and said that the ‘banter’ in his son’s politics class\nwas the context for his son’s yearbook entry. He said that by taking the\nyearbook entry out of its context and ignoring its humorous nature, the\nnewspaper had inaccurately portrayed his son as a neo-Nazi. In addition, he\nsaid it was normal for his son to quote historical figures in in his academic\nwork, and that quoting figures such as Hitler does not mean he subscribes to\ntheir ideology. He said it was inaccurate to claim his son had praised Hitler,\nor that his son’s yearbook entry contained “vile Nazi comments attributed to a\npupil”, and said that the allegation that the school was “nurturing hatred”\nlacked justification.\n7. The complainant said that as far as he was aware, the yearbook was not\npublished online, and was sold to the 110 students in his son’s year group. He\nsaid that anybody who knew his son could identify him from the pixelated\nphotograph, including all the students at his school. He said that the\nnewspaper failed to contact his son prior to publication, and that by\npublishing his yearbook entry, the newspaper had breached his privacy. The\ncomplainant said that as a result of the article, his son had received\nunpleasant comments, that many people had made posts on social media, and that\nhis son had been contacted by another newspaper.\n8. The newspaper said that the yearbook was distributed to at least 100\nstudents and would have been read by countless other individuals once it\nentered the public domain. It said that the complainant’s son was the guardian\nof what information about him he wished to remain private, and in this case, he\nhad waived any right of privacy in respect of the remarks he made in his\nyearbook entry.\n9. The newspaper said that the yearbook was endorsed by a leading school,\nand would be read by pupils and others from diverse sections of society. It\nsaid the yearbook was not a proper vehicle for the complainant’s son to air his\ncomments. In this respect, it said there was a public interest in informing the\npublic about the matter, in a newspaper that has always devoted considerable\ncoverage to education issues.\n10. The newspaper denied that the\narticle was inaccurate. It said there had never been any dispute about the\ncontents of the complainant’s son’s yearbook entry, and said that he was not\napproached for comment as the yearbook entry was in the public domain.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n11. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to\npublish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including\nheadlines not supported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy,\nmisleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due\nprominence, and - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving\nIPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to\nsignificant inaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to\neditorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture\nand fact.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect\nfor his or her private and family life, home, health and correspondence,\nincluding digital communications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify\nintrusions into any individual's private life without consent. Account will be\ntaken of the complainant's own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph\nindividuals, without their consent, in public or private places where there is\na reasonable expectation of privacy.\nClause 3 (Harassment)\ni) Journalists must not engage in\nintimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in\nquestioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing individuals once asked to\ndesist; nor remain on property when asked to leave and must not follow them. If\nrequested, they must identify themselves and whom they represent.\niii) Editors must ensure these principles\nare observed by those working for them and take care not to use non-compliant\nmaterial from other source\nFindings of the Committee\n12. In deciding whether the\ncomplainant’s son had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the\ninformation published by the newspaper, the Committee considered both the\nnature of the information contained in the article, and the extent of the\ncomplainant’s son’s own public disclosure of this information. The\ncomplainant’s son’s responses to the various headings did not disclose\ninformation about his private life; on the complainant’s own account, they were\njokes about political history. In addition, there were more than 100 students\nin the complainant’s son’s year group who were all able to purchase the book,\nand who would be free to show the book to others. The article did not name the\ncomplainant’s son, and his image had been pixelated.  In all the circumstances, the complainant’s\nson did not have reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to the\ninformation contained in the article, and there was no breach of Clause 2.\n13. The complainant’s son had\nresponded to the heading “Best quote”, with a quotation by and attributed to\nAdolf Hitler; had claimed that “in 10 years time”, he would be “Crushing\nSocialism”; had referred to himself as “Fascist”; and had said that his\n“confession” was the Munich Putsch. The article included a prominent image of\nthe yearbook entry in question. The Committee acknowledged the complainant’s\nposition that these were ‘in-jokes’. However, the complainant’s son had written\nthese comments for publication in a yearbook, which could be expected to be\nread without the benefit of that context. The newspaper was entitled to\ninterpret the complainant’s son’s yearbook entry from an external point of\nview, and it was clear from the article that it was doing so. The newspaper was\nentitled to characterise the yearbook entry as “praising” Hitler, and it was\nnot significantly misleading to report that the yearbook entry included “vile\nNazi comments”. The basis for the parent’s claim that the school was “nurturing\nhatred” was made clear, and this aspect of the article was not significantly\nmisleading. The Committee did not establish that the article contained a\nsignificant inaccuracy, or a significantly misleading statement. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1.\n14. The Committee noted the\ncomplainant’s position that his son had received unpleasant comments as a\nresult of the article, and that he had been contacted by the newspaper’s sister\npublication. However, the newspaper was not responsible under the Code for the\ncomments made to the complainant’s son by third parties, or the approach that\nwas made to him by another newspaper. There was no breach of Clause 3.\nConclusions\n15. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n16.
