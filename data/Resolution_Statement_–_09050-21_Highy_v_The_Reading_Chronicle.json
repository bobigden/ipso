    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution\nStatement – 09050-21 Highy v The Reading Chronicle\nSummary\nof Complaint\n1.\nPhilip Highy complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nThe Reading Chronicle breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Birthday honours for Berks residents”, published\non 17th June 2021.\n2. The\narticle reported on the Queen’s birthday honours, celebrating the success of\nindividuals from Berkshire. It stated that “[o]f those from the Royal county\nOBEs have been given to people for services in tackling the coronavirus\npandemic, decarbonising air travel, supporting disabled people and more”. It\nwent on to include a full list of everyone from Berkshire who was honoured,\nreporting that Lynne and Philip Highy had both received awards.\n3. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. He said\nthat he and Lynne Highy had been awarded British Empire Medals, and that the\narticle had inaccurately stated they had been awarded OBEs.\n4. The\npublication accepted that it had, due to human error, incorrectly included\nLynne and Philip Highy on the list of individuals who had been awarded OBEs.\nWhilst the publication accepted that it had inaccurately reported the awards\nLynne and Philip Highy received, it did not accept that this rendered the\narticle wholly misleading.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated\nOutcome\n5. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n6.  During IPSO’s investigation the publication\noffered to print the following correction:\nOn June\n17, 2021, The Reading Chronicle published an article containing the names of a\nnumber of people who received an honour for the Queen’s birthday. A mistake was\nmade in this article and both Philip and Lynne Highy were listed as having\nreceived OBEs. This was inaccurate as both Mr and Mrs Highy received British\nEmpire Medals. Although this article was soon corrected at the time of\npublication, we are happy to issue a further clarification. We apologise to Mr\nand Mrs Highy for any confusion and upset this article may have caused.\n7. The\ncomplainant said that this would resolve the matter to his satisfaction.\n8. As\nthe complaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make\na determination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\n \nDate\ncomplaint received: 04/08/21\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 11/10/21\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
