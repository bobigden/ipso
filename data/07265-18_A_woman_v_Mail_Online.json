It also said that in July 2018 “the police finally dropped the rape\nallegation”. The second article reported that the complainant had accused the\nman of rape “before dropping the allegation earlier this year”. A photograph of\nthe complainant, taken outside of court, accompanied both of the articles. 4.    The complainant said that she had\nbeen identified as a victim of sexual assault, in breach of Clause 11. She said\nthat naming her, publishing her photograph and disclosing the area in which she\nlived had breached her privacy. 5.    The complainant said that the\narticles had implied, inaccurately, that it was she who had dropped the\nallegation of rape. The complainant acknowledged that shortly before her trial,\nthe police had informed her that they were not going to proceed against the man\nin relation to the rape allegation, but said that this was solely because there\nwas no independent evidence available to prove or disprove the allegation. She\nsaid that at the time the article was published, she was engaged in a Victim’s\nRight to Review process and had therefore not withdrawn any part of her\ncomplaint. 6.    The complainant said that it was\ninaccurate to report that she had made the allegation of rape after the affair\nhad ended. She said that she had made the allegation of rape in February 2017 while\nshe was still in a relationship with the man, not after the relationship had ended\nin March 2018. 7.    The publication denied any breach\nof the Code. It said that the article was a report of\nproceedings heard in open court, which did not relate to a defendant being\ntried for an offence of sexual assault. Given this, the newspaper said that it\nwas legally free under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992, to identify\nthe complainant. The publication further said that it was justified in doing\nso: the complainant had been named in open court by the prosecution as having\nmade the allegation of rape. The publication said that the allegation of rape,\nmade in conjunction with the harassing telephone calls, would have undoubtedly\nformed part of the conduct which distressed the victim. 8.    The publication said that the\narticle accurately reported that the police had decided to “drop” the rape\nallegation; they had decided not to proceed against the man as there was\ninsufficient evidence and no reasonable prospect of conviction. The publication\nacknowledged that the phrasing of the second article indicated that the\ndecision to “drop” the rape allegation had been made by the complainant earlier\nin 2018. It said that the court had heard that the decision to drop the\nallegation was first taken in 2017 and then, later by the police in 2018. It\nsaid that to ensure clarity, it would amend the article to read: “she even\naccused him of rape before the police decided to take no further action earlier\nthis year”. 9.    The publication disputed the complainant’s\ntimeline of events. It said that the court heard complainant’s relationship\nwith the man ended in February 2017. \nRelevant\nCode provisions 10. Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading\nor distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the\ntext. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion\nmust be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and- where appropriate- an\napology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as\nrequired by the regulator. \nClause 2 (Privacy) * i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and\nfamily life, home, health and correspondence, including digital communications. ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual’s private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosures of information. iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their\nconsent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. \nClause 11 (Victims of sexual assault) The press must not identify or publish material likely to lead to the identification of a victim of sexual assault unless there is adequate justification and they are legally free to do so. Findings of the Committee 11. The Committee acknowledged the complainant’s position that she was\na victim of sexual assault and therefore should not have been identified in the\narticle. Under Clause 11 of the Code, victims of sexual assault may only be\nidentified by publications in circumstances where there is adequate\njustification and they are legally free to do so. In law, and under the Code,\nvictims of sexual assault are granted anonymity in reports of criminal proceedings\nwhich are brought against a defendant for alleged sexual offences. 12. However, the law allows\nvictims of sexual assault to be identified in legal proceedings in which a\ndefendant is not being tried for an offence of sexual assault, but with which\nthe victim is involved. The Committee was satisfied that on the facts of this\ncase, the publication was, as is required under the terms of Clause 11, legally\nfree to name the complainant. The Committee\nacknowledged the importance of the principle of open justice which ordinarily\nallows the press to identify the parties to legal proceedings, unless precluded\nby law.  The\narticle was a report of court proceedings in which the complainant was on trial\ncharged with harassment; part of the prosecution’s case against her was the\nallegation of sexual assault which she had made against the man. There was a\npublic interest in reporting what was heard in court in respect of the\ncomplainant’s trial in an open and transparent way. The Committee noted that no\nreporting restriction had been imposed which prevented the complainant being\nidentified, despite the complainant’s request. In these particular\ncircumstances, the publication was justified in naming the complainant in the\narticle and including the information that she had made an allegation that she\nwas the victim of sexual assault. There was no breach of Clause 11. 13. The published\nphotograph disclosed only the complainant’s likeness, as she had appeared\noutside of court. No private information was revealed about the complainant.\nThere was no breach of Clause 2. 14. The article was a report of the\nprosecution’s case against the complainant. It was not disputed that the\nprosecution had alleged that the complainant had made the allegation of rape\nafter the affair had ended. It was not inaccurate to report that the police had\n“dropped” the rape allegation; they had decided not to proceed against the man.\nThe articles did not state explicitly that it was the complainant who had\ndropped the allegation. There was no breach of Clause 1. \nConclusions 15. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial\nAction Required 14. N/A\nDate complaint received: 08/11/2018Date decision issued: 12/04/2019\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer \nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer\nabout the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent\nComplaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold\nthe request for review.\n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
