It reported that police and fire\ncrews had launched an investigation into the explosion. The article was\naccompanied by two photographs showing the side of the house which had lost its\nexternal walls, so that the interior of the house was visible.  Some\nfurniture and other items were visible in this photograph, including the rear\nof a book case, a desktop computer, a shower and a bath.\n3.\nThe complainant said that the photographs were taken on her land at the rear of\nthe house, and that no one had approached her about taking them. She said that\nher bathroom and stairs were clearly visible in the photograph, and that this\naspect of the property had not been visible to members of the public.  She\nsaid that the contents of her home are private, and that the photograph was\nintrusive. She noted that members of the public had joked about her bath, which\nwas shown hanging off the side of the building. She said that her house was\nlooted, which the police warned her would happen after the pictures were\npublished. The complainant said that she did not object to the publication\nreporting on the incident, or the use of photographs taken from the nearby\npublic road.\n4.\nThe publication said that the photograph showed the damage which had been\ncaused to the property. It said that a person stood on a public road would have\nbeen able to see that the property was damaged, and that the photographs did\nnot reveal any new private information.\n5.\nThe publication said that the agency photographer had originally taken some\nphotographs from the road, but did not have a good view of the most damaged\npart of the house. After asking around in the area, the photographer spoke to a\nman who identified himself as the complainant’s father, and the owner of the\nproperty. He asked where he could a take a picture of the damage to the house,\nand he was directed to a spot at the rear of the property, which was where the\nphotographs were taken. The publication said that this spot was accessed\nwithout crossing any barriers or cordons, or opening any gates.\n6.\nThe complainant said that her father was unable to recall his conversations\nwith the press, but that he was sure that he did not escort, indicate or show\nanybody to a position where they could take the photographs. The complainant\nsaid that the fire brigade had cordoned off the land on which the photographs\nwere taken with tape.  She said that while the publication had argued that\npublishing the photographs was in the public interest, it had not been\ninterested in what had caused the explosion, nor did she believe the public\nwould be better informed about the importance of gas safety as a result of the\nreporting.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\n7.\nClause 3 (Privacy)\ni)\nEveryone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home,\nhealth and correspondence, including digital communications.\nii)\nEditors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private\nlife without consent. Account will be taken of the complainant's own public\ndisclosures of information.\nThe\nPublic Interest\n1.\nThe public interest includes, but is not confined to:\nii)\nProtecting public health and safety\nFindings\nof the Committee\n8.\nThe Committee recognised the difficulty and distress the gas explosion caused\nthe complainant. It appreciated that the publication of this footage may have\ncaused the complainant additional distress at what was a difficult time.\n9.\nHowever, given the extent of the damage, including the destruction of external\nwalls, the visibility of some of the damage from a public road, the presence of\nemergency services and the fact that the explosion was a significant and\nlegitimate news story, the complainant did not have a reasonable expectation\nthat her property was a private place. The furniture and other items depicted\nin the photographs were common household items which did not reveal any\nparticular details about the complainant’s private life, and the photographs\nonly showed what could be seen by standing at the rear of the property; the\nphotographer did not enter the building.  In addition, there was a public\ninterest in illustrating the extent of the damage caused by the gas explosion,\nwhich highlighted the importance of gas safety. Because of the extent of the\ndamage, it would not have been possible to do so without showing some of what\nhad previously been the internal contents of the house.\n10.\nOn the newspaper’s account, the complainant’s father identified himself, and\nexplained where the photographer should stand to get the best picture. The\ncomplainant denied that her father escorted the photographer to this spot or\nindicated where to go, but said that her father could not recollect what he had\nsaid in his conversations to the press. In these circumstances, the Committee\naccepted the account of the conversation provided by the newspaper.\n11.\nThis gas explosion was the legitimate subject of news coverage, and\nillustrating the extent of the damage was in the public interest. There was no\nfailure to respect the complainant’s privacy, and there was no breach of Clause\n3.\nConclusions\n12.\nThe complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\nN/A\nDate\ncomplaint received: 15/12/2015Date\ndecision issued: 02/03/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
