A woman complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that the Daily Record had breached Clause 3 (Privacy) and Clause\n14 (Confidential sources) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Blind 7/7 bombings survivor reveals how she was forced to flee Scotland\nover stalking terror”, published on 7 July 2015. \n2. The article was an interview with the complainant\nwhich was published on the anniversary of the 7 July 2005 bombings. It reported\nthat she had left London following the attacks, and had now had to move again\nas she had been the victim of stalking. \n3. The story had initially been published in another\nnewspaper; that article was the subject of a separate complaint to IPSO. The\ncomplainant said that, prior to publication of the initial article, she had\nbeen contacted by a freelance journalist, a man with whom she had previously\nworked, who wanted to interview her; they arranged a telephone call. The\ncomplainant said that during the call they discussed her experiences of the\nbombings; the fact that she was being stalked and had had to move home a number\nof times; and her career. She said that she had asked that no details relating\nto her being stalked be published; those details were “between them”. The\ncomplainant said that she had also asked that her current location not be\nrevealed, in order to protect her safety; this omission had been agreed by the\njournalist. \n4. About an hour after the interview the journalist rang\nthe complainant to ask if she had reported the stalking matter to the police; she\nsaid that she told him during this conversation that the details relating to\nher stalking were private. Five hours later she emailed the journalist to say\nthat she had been thinking about the conversation and was concerned about the\ninclusion in the article of any reference to her being stalked. The journalist\nreplied saying that the story had been written and submitted to publications,\nand it included that the reason why the complainant had moved was that she was\nbeing stalked. He said that his understanding was that the complainant had\nrequested that nothing in the article reveal where she was living now, and he\nhad ensured that that was the case. The complainant acknowledged in\ncorrespondence with IPSO that it was clear from the journalist’s recollection\nof the conversation that he had not heard her request. The journalist told her\nthat it was too late to remove the story from the next day’s newspaper. \n5. The newspaper said that it had not received the story\nfrom the freelance journalist the complainant had spoken to, but had followed\nup a version which had appeared in a different newspaper. As the complainant\nhad been quoted in the article the newspaper assumed that she had co-operated\nwith it. It noted that the article had not identified the complainant’s current\nplace of residence, but said that if it had known that the complainant had not\nwanted information about her being stalked to be included in the article, it\nwould have omitted it. It said that it did not believe that the fact that the\ncomplainant was being stalked was private information. It said that the\ncomplainant had spoken about the fact that she was being stalked during a\nspeech at a conference in 2015, as she called for unions to increase measures\nto protect women in the entertainment industry. An article about that speech\nhad been published on the website of a specialist newspaper. However, in light\nof the concerns raised by the complainant, the newspaper apologised to her;\nremoved the article from its website; and said that it was examining its\nprotocols around following up stories from other newspapers to try and avoid a\nsimilar situation occurring again. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 3 (Privacy) \ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. \nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into\nany individual’s private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosures of information. \nClause 14 (Confidential sources) \nJournalists have a moral obligation to protect\nconfidential sources of information. \nThe public interest \n4. The Regulator will consider the extent to which\nmaterial is already in the public domain, or will become so.  \nFindings of the Committee\n7. The Committee understood that the complainant was in a\nvulnerable position, and that she was concerned for her safety. \n8. The Committee had already established, separately,\nthat the initial article in the other newspaper did not raise a breach of the\nEditors’ Code. That decision informed its consideration of the complaint\nagainst the Daily Record. \n9. The initial conversation had been clearly\ndistinguished as an interview for publication, and the journalist was someone\nwith whom she had previously worked. The Committee noted the complainant’s\nacceptance that the journalist had not acknowledged her request, and it was\nclear that there had been no specific agreement to exclude details about the\nstalking from the article. In addition, the information was already in the\npublic domain following the complainant’s conference speech. The article under\ncomplaint had not given any indication of the complainant’s current place of\nresidence, and so the Committee did not consider that the newspaper’s actions\nhad compromised the complainant’s safety. The Committee found that the article\ndid not represent an unjustified intrusion into the complainant’s private life;\nthe complaint under Clause 3 was not upheld. \n10. There was no suggestion that an agreement had been\nmade that the complainant be treated as a confidential source; there was no\nbreach of Clause 14. \nConclusions\n11. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 13/07/2015\nDate decision issued: 08/09/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
