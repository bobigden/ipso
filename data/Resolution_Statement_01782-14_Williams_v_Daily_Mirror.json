Chris Williams\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Daily\nMirror breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “A date with death”, published on 8 November 2014.\n2. The article\nreported that Cerys Yemm had been killed by Matthew Williams, whom it described\nas “cannibal killer”. The article stated that the victim had met Mr Williams on\na night out and accompanied him back to his hostel, where she had been killed in\nan attack that involved acts of cannibalism.\n3. The complainant\nwas the father of Matthew Williams. He said that it was inaccurate to refer to\nhis son as a “cannibal,” as at the time of publication no cause of death had\nbeen established. The complainant said that this claim was based on statements\nby witnesses and locals, which he believed were inaccurate.\n4. The complainant\nand publication agreed to put the complaint on hold until after the inquests\nwere complete and the full details of the event were known.\n5. The complainant\nsaid that the inquest had found that cannibalism had not taken place, and\ntherefore it had been inaccurate for the publication to report this when it had\nnot been confirmed as fact.\n6. The newspaper\ndid not accept that it had breached the Code. It said that the article had been\nbased on eye witness accounts, including a 999 call heard at the inquest. It\nsaid that the findings of the inquest did not make the article inaccurate, as\nit was published before the findings of the inquest were known; however they\nhad published subsequent articles reporting the findings of the inquests, which\nmade clear that no acts of cannibalism had taken place.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n8. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n9. Following\nIPSO’s intervention, the publication added links to the follow-up articles to\nthe original article so that readers were aware of the outcome of the inquest.\n10. The complainant said that this resolved the matter to\nhis satisfaction.\n11. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 13/11/2014Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 16/06/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
