Mercidita Darwin\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The Sun\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3 (Harassment) and\nClause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge) of the Editors’ Code of Practice\nin an article headlined “You canoe be serious: Canoe man fraudster John Darwin\ncelebrates his birthday with his new, younger Filipino wife on seaside\nholiday…which included ‘jaunts in a canoe’”, published on 4 November 2016.\n2. The complainant\nexpressed concern that the newspaper had inaccurately reported that she and her\nhusband had celebrated his birthday by taking a canoe trip, and that he had\nsought to claim £679,000 in an attempted life insurance fraud; the correct\nfigure was £250,000. She also said that the newspaper had published private\nphotographs, which had been taken from Google+, without permission. She said\nthe story was intrusive and the newspaper’s conduct had amounted to harassment.\n3. The newspaper\ndid not accept any breach of the Code. It said that while it had incorrectly\nnamed the resort, the complainant and her husband had stayed at a resort which\noffered canoe trips. It also did not consider that the exact sum which Mr\nDarwin had attempted to defraud was significant in the context of his\nconviction. The newspaper denied that the article was intrusive; it said that\nthe images had been taken from a social media account which was open to the\npublic.  \nRelevant Code provisions\n4. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital communications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nClause 3 (Harassment)\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\niii)  Editors must\nensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care\nnot to use non-compliant material from other sources.\nClause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge)\ni) The press must not seek to obtain or publish material\nacquired by using hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices; or by\nintercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails; or by the\nunauthorised removal of documents or photographs; or by accessing\ndigitally-held information without consent.\nii) Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including\nby agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public\ninterest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.\nMediated outcome\n5. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n6. During IPSO’s\ninvestigation of the complaint, the newspaper contacted the complainant\ndirectly and the parties agreed terms by which the complaint could be resolved.\n7. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 01/10/2016Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 11/03/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
