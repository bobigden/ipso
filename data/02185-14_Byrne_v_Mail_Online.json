Michael Byrne complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Mail Online had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Osborne scraps hated\nstamp duty system from midnight and only £1million homes will pay more in\ndramatic attempt to boost home ownership”, published on 3 December 2014. \n2. The article was a report on the Chancellor of the\nExchequer’s Autumn Statement to Parliament. \n3. The complainant said that headline was misleading as it\nstated that stamp duty is being “scrapped”, and that only homes of £1m will pay\nmore. This was, he said, inconsistent with the claim made in the body of the\narticle that stamp duty would increase from 1 % to 2% on houses sold between\n£125,000 and £250,000, and that it would increase from 3% to 5% on houses sold\nbetween £250,000 and £1,000,000. \n4. The newspaper said that under the old system, the rate of\nstamp duty was imposed on the entire value of the property. Under the new\nsystem, stamp duty would only be charged on amount of money above the threshold\nfor that rate.  It said that the phrase\n“hated stamp duty system” in the headline referred to the old system, which was\nbeing replaced, and that the headline was therefore not misleading. It said\nthat data from HM Treasury documents published on the day of the Autumn\nStatement demonstrated that the tax paid on houses above £937,500 will rise under\nthe new system, but tax paid will fall on houses below this level. \n5. The newspaper said that the article was updated\nthroughout the day, and that the version of the article under complaint had\nbeen published soon after the Chancellor had finished his statement.  It said that whilst it was correct to say\nthat “only £1million homes will pay more”, the headline of the article was\nchanged later in the day, and an updated version of the article made clear that\nstamp duty would be levied on the amount of a property’s value above the\nrelevant threshold. The newspaper published a footnote at the bottom of the\narticle which clarified that the headline on the earlier version of the article\nreferred to the “slab system” of paying stamp duty being abolished, rather than\nthe tax itself. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving the\nRegulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance. \nFindings of the Committee\n7. The Committee recognised that the statement “Osborne\nscraps hated stamp duty system”, was ambiguous between stamp duty being\nabolished and a change in the way that stamp duty operated. This ambiguity was\nresolved when the headline was read in the context of the article, which made\nclear that the Chancellor had announced a change in how stamp duty operated,\nrather than its abolition. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point. \n8. The Committee turned to the alleged inconsistency between\nthe headline claim that “only £1million homes will pay more”, with the\nincreases in stamp duty rates reported in the article. The Committee recognised\nthat the increases in stamp duty rates were reported without a clear\nexplanation that under the new system, these higher rates would only be levied\non the value of the property above the threshold for that rate. However, the\narticle did explain that the “slab system”, in which the stamp duty paid in a\nproperty sale increases sharply at certain thresholds, was being replaced by a\nnew system, in which amounts paid on house sales will rise gradually. In these\ncircumstances, the Committee considered that the manner in which the increased\nstamp duty rates were reported was not significantly misleading. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1. \n9. The Committee acknowledged that the article was updated\nas the details of the Chancellor’s statement were being established, and it\nwelcomed the publication of a footnote which explained that an earlier headline\nfor the article had been referring to the “slab system” of stamp duty being\nabolished, rather than the tax itself.  \nConclusions\n10. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate of complaint: 03/12/2014\nDate decision issued: 03/03/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
