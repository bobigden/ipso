Leigh Graham complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that dailystar.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and\nClause 2 (Privacy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined\n“Liverpool fan rinsed for modelling in full 1993 home kit he's selling on\neBay”, published on 31 July 2020.\n2. The article reported on an advert on eBay for a Liverpool\nFC kit which they reported was being sold by a “Liverpool fan”. The article\ndescribed that the eBay advert had gone viral, and included many comments aimed\nat the person selling the football kit. The article also reported that the\nadvert had gone live “after the Reds won the Premier League” and that it was\n“brazen attempts to make a quick buck of the back of his side's Premier League\ntitle win by listing a vintage kit on eBay for £150”.\n3. The complainant, the man selling the kit and featured in\nthe photos said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 as he was\nnot a Liverpool fan, and that the kit had been up for sale on eBay for over a\nyear, and had not been listed to make money after Liverpool won the Premier\nLeague as stated in the article.\n4. The complainant also said that the article breached his\nprivacy under Clause 2, as the article had caused further intrusion and\nderogatory comments on social media. He also said that the social media posts\nthat the newspaper had shared were insulting.\n5. The publication said that it did not believe that there\nwas a breach of Clause 1 as neither of the alleged inaccuracies were\nsignificant. It offered to amend the article to remove these comments as a\ngesture of goodwill.\n6. The publication said that as the images and information\nwas taken from an open eBay advert, the complainant had no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy under Clause 2.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n8. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n9. The publication offered to delete the article and the\nsocial media posts promoting it.\n10. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto his satisfaction.\n11. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 31/07/2020\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 01/09/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
