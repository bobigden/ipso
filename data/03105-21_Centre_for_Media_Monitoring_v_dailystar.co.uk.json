    "conclusion_long": "that this did not happen. [It] could find no trace of any such incident or report by any member of [its] staff over the past two years”. NWAS also stated that it did “not recognise his voice or the description of him as one of [its] staff members”. The complainant said they had also contacted the Manchester Council of Mosques and the Oldham Council of Mosques, and that both organisations had also denied knowledge of such an incident occurring. In light of this, the complainant said that the publication had breached Clause 1 because it had published the claims of this individual, that used anti-Islamic tropes, without verification. 4. The publication did not accept a breach of the Code. It said it had taken care as the article had clearly distinguished between comment, conjecture, and fact. The article had also reported that it had contacted NWAS for comment. The publication provided the email that they had sent to NWAS asking for comment on the caller’s allegation, which had been sent at 12.22 on 28 March, 39 minutes prior to publication of the article. NWAS responded the following day, while the reporter was annual leave, stating that it did not believe the allegations to be true and requesting the article be removed; this was done two days later, on 31 March, when the reporter returned from annual leave. 5. Upon receipt of the complaint, and prior to IPSO’s investigation, the publication deleted the article and published a standalone clarification with the headline “Clarification” which stated: Daily Star published an article on March 28, 2021 about a man who claimed to have suffered homophobia while visiting a mosque in Manchester. The man, who identified only as [named individual], called radio station talkRADIO and claimed to host Christos Foufas that he was refused entry to treat a heart attack patient inside a mosque in Manchester because of his sexual orientation. He did not name the mosque where the alleged incident took place. This site has since been contacted by North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) who could find no evidence of such an incident happening. A spokesperson for North West Ambulance Service (NWAS), said: “The trust was only made aware of this allegation following the individual’s comments on the live radio broadcast. Our investigations so far have found no record of this incident and contrary to what the caller said on air, the local management team have not been informed of any such exchange taking place. We therefore have no reason to believe that the allegations made by someone maintaining to be an NWAS member of staff are true. We have good relationships with faith leaders in Oldham and across the North West and don’t see the remarks as representative of the situation in any of our local communities. In addition, the Manchester Council of Mosques and the Oldham Council of Mosques denied knowledge of any such incident taking place. We are happy to clarify this.\" 6. The complainant did not consider that this resolved its complaint and requested a meeting between the publication’s Editor-in-Chief and its Director in order to do so. 7. The newspaper was satisfied that the complaint had been dealt with appropriately. Relevant Code Provisions Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator.  iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for. iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. Findings of the Committee 8. The article reported on a radio interview in which a man, who claimed to be a paramedic, purported to give an account of being prevented from treating a patient in a mosque in Oldham due to his sexual orientation. The man identified himself only by a first name and did not identify the mosque or give the date on which the alleged incident was said to have occurred. The article provided a detailed summary of his account, which was attributed to him by the use of words such as “alleged” and “claimed” throughout to distinguish it as comment. The claims made by the individual as reported in the article were significant as the article was solely focussed on his alleged experiences. 9. The caller had said that he had made a complaint to the NWAS following the alleged incident, and the publication had contacted NWAS to seek its comments prior to publication. However, it had then published the story less than an hour later, without providing a reasonable opportunity for NWAS to respond. In the response which was provided by NWAS the following day, it expressed the view that the alleged incident had not taken place.  There had then been a further delay in taking any action following receipt of the response before the article was removed. The account of the caller which was reported in the article included a number of very serious allegations on a highly sensitive issue.  Further, it had been given in circumstances where no steps had been taken to verify the account, despite the limited information given by the man in support of its veracity.  The newspaper appeared to acknowledge that these circumstances merited some action being taken to verify the account before publication, but had then not given NWAS an adequate amount of time to comment, publishing the article only 39 minutes after a request for comment had been made.  Publishing unverified claims of this nature in such circumstances and failing immediately to include the comments provided by NWAS, constituted a failure to take care and there was a breach of Clause 1(i). 10. Prior to IPSO’s investigation, the publication had deleted the article and had published a standalone clarification which made clear that, following an investigation, NWAS had concluded that the alleged incident had not taken place. It also included the position of the Manchester Council of Mosques and the Oldham Council of Mosques who also denied that the incident had occurred. This put the correct position on record and as it was offered prior to the start of IPSO’s investigation, represented due promptness. As a standalone clarification, it was of due prominence. As such, there was no breach of Clause 1(ii). Conclusion(s) 11. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1.",

The\nCentre for Media Monitoring complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that dailystar.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’\nCode of Practice in an article headlined “Gay paramedic says he was refused\nentry to a mosque to treat heart attack patient”, published on 28 March 2021.\n2. The\narticle reported that an individual had called into a radio programme and had\npurportedly given an account of an incident with which he said he had been\ninvolved. The caller, who identified himself only by a first name, claimed to\nbe a paramedic in Manchester and said that he was openly gay and had\n“piercings” and “alleged to have experienced discrimination and violent\nthreats”. He described an incident in which he “claimed he was refused entry to\na mosque to treat a heart attack patient because of homophobia”. The caller\nexplained that he had arrived at the mosque when someone standing outside had\nquestioned his sexuality and then told him he “look[ed] funny”. The article\nreported that the caller had asked “'Do you mean I look gay?'”. It said that,\nafter he confirmed his sexuality, he was refused entry to the mosque and\nanother paramedic had to be called to the incident.  The article reported that the caller did not\nname the mosque during the interview but “said he had complained and North West\nAmbulance Service had spoken to the Imam”. The article also reported that the\ncaller had said that there are “certain areas [he] won’t go without a police\npresence”. A video of the radio programme was contained within the article.\n3. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. It said\nit had investigated the allegations by speaking to North West Ambulance Service\n(NWAS), which the caller had said he reported the incident to. NWAS issued a\nstatement in response in which it said that it had come “to the conclusion that\nthis did not happen. [It] could find no trace of any such incident or report by\nany member of [its] staff over the past two years”. NWAS also stated that it\ndid “not recognise his voice or the description of him as one of [its] staff\nmembers”. The complainant said they had also contacted the Manchester Council\nof Mosques and the Oldham Council of Mosques, and that both organisations had\nalso denied knowledge of such an incident occurring.
