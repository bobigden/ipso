Rachelle Romeo complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that an article published by the Enfield Advertiser on\n10 September 2014, headlined “Residents hit the roof over temple”, was\ninaccurate, in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice,\nintruded into her privacy in breach of Clause 3 (Privacy), was discriminatory\nin breach of Clause 12 (Discrimination), and included her name in breach of\nClause 14 (Confidential sources). \n2. The article reported concerns which local residents had\nraised about the building works being undertaken to construct a Hindu temple in\nEdmonton, London. The article included the complainant’s comments that the\nconstruction work was noisy and dusty, and also that visitors to the temple\nwere placing heavy demand on parking spaces in the area. The article also\ncontained a response from a project manager for the temple’s construction. \n3. The complainant had approached the newspaper initially to\nask whether it was willing to publish an article about her concerns. The\nnewspaper expressed an interest in the story, and asked the complainant whether\nshe would be willing to go on the record. The complainant responded: “That’s\nfine”, but went on to say that “prior to any publishing, can we sit down before\nI fully grant permission because I am very interested myself and would like to\nknow what angle your article will cover”. \n4. The complainant considered that the article was\ninaccurate because it did not fully represent her concerns, or those of the\nlocal people.  She said that the\ninclusion of her full name, address and age in the article intruded into her\nprivacy; she was unhappy that her personal details were published. She said\nthat the newspaper had included her name without providing her with an\nopportunity to read the article beforehand. She was further concerned that the\narticle was discriminatory as it had not represented both sides of the issue\nwithout bias. \n5. The newspaper said that the article was not inaccurate;\nit was a balanced story featuring comments from both sides. It said that it had\nnot agreed to withhold the complainant’s name, and that it was not the\nnewspaper’s policy to give copy approval. It said that the complainant had\nasked when a photographer was coming to take her photograph. It also considered\nthat the complainant expected the newspaper to publish an article “slanted to\nher opinion”.  \nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving the\nRegulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance. \nClause 3 (Privacy) \ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. \nClause 12 (Discrimination) \ni) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference\nto an individual's race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or to any\nphysical or mental illness or disability. \nii) Details of an individual's race, colour, religion,\nsexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided\nunless genuinely relevant to the story. \nClause 14 (Confidential sources)\ni) Journalists have a moral obligation to protect\nconfidential sources of information. \nFindings of the Committee\n7. The Committee noted the complainant’s view that the\narticle had not adequately represented the concerns she had raised in her\nletter, or the concerns of the local community, but rather had published an\narticle that was “biased” towards the temple. However, the newspaper was\nentitled to report comments from a representative of the temple, and the fact\nthat the article was not an exhaustive account of the complainant’s letter or\nthe concerns of local residents did not raise a breach of Clause 1. \n8. The complainant had contacted the newspaper with the aim\nof publicising her concerns about the temple, and had agreed to have her\nphotograph taken. While the Committee acknowledged the complainant’s view that\nshe would be afforded copy approval prior to publication, in these\ncircumstances, and given that the complainant had pro-actively contacted the\nnewspaper, the inclusion of her full name, age, and the name of the road on\nwhich she lived did not represent an intrusion into her private life. There was\nno breach of Clause 3. \n9. The Committee noted the complainant’s position that her\nagreement to be named was conditional on being given the opportunity to see the\narticle prior to publication. However, the complainant had not been provided\nwith an assurance that she would be treated as a confidential source, and the\ndecision to publish the article without providing her with an opportunity for\ncopy approval did not raise a breach of Clause 14. \n10. The article did not discriminate against any individual\non the basis of race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or any\nphysical or mental illness or disability. There was no breach of Clause 12. \nConclusions\n11. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 25/09/2014\nDate decision issued: 14/01/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
