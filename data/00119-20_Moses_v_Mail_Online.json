Sian Moses complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that Mail Online breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy),\nClause 11 (Victims of sexual assault) and Clause 12 (Discrimination) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Lesbian children's home\nofficial, 38, boasted 'I can turn any woman gay' and discussed her use of sex\ntoys says colleague 'who she groped and tried to kiss'”, published on 26\nNovember 2019.2. The article reported on a hearing before the Fitness to\nPractice Committee of the Education Workforce Council into allegations made\nagainst a children’s home official that she had made sexual advances and\ncomments towards another female, a married co-worker referred to as “Colleague\nA”, whilst on duty. The article reported that the official said “that the roles\nwere reversed and that it was Colleague A who made the advances towards her.”\nIt listed allegations against her such as her having allegedly told other staff\nmembers that “I can turn any woman gay”. The article also included photos of\nthe children’s home official, which had been taken from her Facebook page, and\none of her walking down the street. After this article was published, the\nFitness to Practice Committee of the Education Workforce Council found the\nchildren’s home official’s behaviour did not amount to unacceptable\nprofessional conduct.3. The complainant, the children’s home official who was subject\nto the hearing, said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. She\nsaid it inaccurately reported that she had said that she could “turn any woman\ngay”. The complainant said that it was her colleagues who said this not her.\nShe also said it was inaccurate to report that she had allegedly made sexual\nadvances towards her colleague; in fact she was the one who had received the\nunwanted sexual advances. The complainant also said it was inaccurate not to\nreport that the colleague she had been accused of making advances towards was\nmarried to a woman; the headline made it seem that the colleague was\nheterosexual and married to a man.4. The complainant also said that the article breached Clause 2\nbecause it included photographs that had been taken from her Facebook profile\nand a photo of her on the street that was taken without her knowledge. The\ncomplainant said that her Facebook profile was set so it could only be seen by\nfriends and friends of friends, and could not be seen by journalists and it\ntherefore breached her privacy to publish these photos.5. The complainant also said that the article breached Clause 11\nas it named her, when it was the other, unnamed, colleague who had made the\nsexual advances towards her.6. The complainant also said that the article breached Clause 12\nas it discriminated against her as a lesbian.7. The publication said it did not accept any breaches of the\nCode. It said that the reference to the complainant making comments of a sexual\nnature came from the findings of the hearing. It also said that it had included\nthe complainant’s counter-allegation, that she had been the victim of the\nsexual advances, within the article. It was not necessary to include the\nmarital status or sexual orientation of the colleague, as the article reported\non the complainant’s hearing, and the colleague’s sexuality or marital status\nwere not relevant. Additionally, it said that the headline referred only to the\ncomplainant and not to the colleague.8. The publication said that the two photos did not intrude into\nthe complainant’s privacy. The photos from Facebook were openly available, and\nit provided screenshots to support this. The photograph of the complainant\noutside was taken on a public street and did not depict her engaging in any sensitive,\nprivate or compromising acts – it was simply a picture of her walking. It also\nsaid that it was entitled to report on her official hearing.9. The publication considered that it was unclear exactly what\nsexual misconduct the complainant was alleging to be the victim of; it appeared\nthat she was claiming to be the victim of the conduct she had been accused of,\nmeaning unacceptable professional conduct. It did not consider that its article\nhad identified the complainant as a victim of sexual assault, nor did it\nconsider that “advances” having been made towards her reached the threshold\nrequired for “sexual assault” under Clause 11. The publication said that it had\nmerely reported the allegations, which had been the subject of an open hearing\nwhere the complainant had been named; the complainant’s claims were not the\nsubject of the tribunal’s investigation. Furthermore, it noted that the police had\nseen and reviewed text messages between the complainant and her colleague and\nhad concluded that their relationship was consensual, and this had been noted\nin the findings of the tribunal. It also noted that the police had not\nconsidered the complainant to be a victim of sexual abuse.10. The publication said the article was not discriminatory\ntowards the complainant. It had not used any discriminatory references, and\nwhilst it had reported on her gender and sexual orientation, this was genuinely\nrelevant to the story as it was heard in the context of the sexual advances she\nhad allegedly made.Relevant Code Provisions11. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading\nor distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the\ntext.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion\nmust be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate —\nan apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as\nrequired by the regulator. iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.12. Clause 2 (Privacy)*i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and\nfamily life, home, health and correspondence, including digital communications.ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their\nconsent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy.13. Clause 11 (Victims of sexual assault)The press must not identify or publish material likely to lead to\nthe identification of a victim of sexual assault unless there is adequate\njustification and they are legally free to do so. Journalists are entitled to\nmake enquiries but must take care and exercise discretion to avoid the\nunjustified disclosure of the identity of a victim of sexual assault.14. Clause 12 (Discrimination)i) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an\nindividual's, race, colour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation\nor to any physical or mental illness or disability.ii) Details of an individual's race, colour, religion, gender\nidentity, sexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be\navoided unless genuinely relevant to the story.Findings of the Committee15. The Committee noted the complainant’s position that it was her\ncolleagues who had said that she could “turn any woman gay”. It was the\npublication’s position that these were allegations that had been made during\nthe hearing, and it had accurately reported them. The complainant had not\ndemonstrated that these allegations were not made during the hearing and due\ncare had been taken in reporting them as allegations. The Committee therefore\nfound that the publication had taken care to avoid inaccuracy in reporting what\nwas heard in the complainant’s hearing and there was no breach of Clause 1 on\nthis point.16. The Committee noted the complainant’s position that she had\nbeen the victim of sexual advances made by Colleague A. The Committee found\nthat the newspaper was entitled to report on the hearing before the Fitness to\nPractice Committee, which concerned the allegations which had been made against\nthe complainant. The article made clear that these were allegations which the\ncomplainant denied and her position that the advances were made by Colleague A.\nThe article also made clear that the hearing was ongoing and there was no\nsuggestion that she had been found guilty. There was no failure to take care\nover the accuracy of the article on this point. There was no breach of Clause\n1.17. The Committee found that it was not misleading to omit sexual\norientation or marital status of Colleague A from the article, as these matters\nhad no bearing on the report of the complainant’s hearing. It did not find that\nthe headline implied that Colleague A was married to a man. There was no breach\nof Clause 1.18. The Committee found that the Facebook pictures were openly\navailable on the complainant’s profile. It also noted that the photograph,\nwhich had been taken without the complainant’s knowledge, had been taken on a\npublic street and simply showed her likeness, and not any private activity\nabout which she had a reasonable expectation of privacy. Neither of the images\ndisclosed anything private about the complainant. There was no breach of Clause\n2.19. The Committee noted the complainant’s position that sexual\nadvances had been made towards her. However, the publication had not identified\nthe complainant as a victim of sexual assault; “sexual advances” do not meet\nthis threshold. In light of this, the terms of Clause 11 had not been engaged.20. The Committee noted that the article referred to the\ncomplainant’s sexual orientation and gender. It had not, however, used\nprejudicial or pejorative references to either her sexual orientation or\ngender, and, due to the allegations heard at the hearing, the complainant’s\nsexual orientation was genuinely relevant to the story. There was no breach of\nClause 12.Conclusions21. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial Action Required22.
