The article reported that two men\nhad set fire to the house in a case of mistaken identity, and that the family\nwere forced to the leave their home. The article stated that the complainant\nhad made a public appeal for information on Facebook and also included a\nstatement from a Detective who appealed for those with information to come\nforward. The article also contained information about a Just Giving page set up\nto raise money for the family and included a photograph of the exterior of the\nproperty after the attack. \n3.    The\ncomplainant said that the article contained the name and age of his young\ndaughter, who was a victim of the attack. The complainant was concerned that\nthe inclusion of these details infringed on his daughter’s privacy and affected\nher safety in breach of Clause 2 and Clause 6 of the Editors’ Code. \n4.    The\ncomplainant also expressed concern that the newspaper had handled the details\nof the attack insensitively by including information about him and his family\nand that this had added to their distress in breach of Clause 4. The\ncomplainant said he had been contacted by the newspaper on Facebook and had not\nresponded and so considered that the newspaper should not have published the\nfamily’s details. The complainant said that he had put a public post on\nFacebook containing details about the attack, which included the names of\nhimself, his partner and daughter in an appeal for information. He did not\nthink that publically sharing this information justified the newspaper’s\npublication of these details. \n5.    The\ncomplainant also said that publishing the full names of the family members\ninvolved, their partial address and a picture of the house after the attack,\nrepresented an intrusion into their private life and as they were victims of\ncrime, their safety had been put at risk. \n6.    The\nnewspaper said that they became aware of the incident through a public\nstatement issued by Merseyside Police Press Office that appealed for\ninformation on this serious crime. The newspaper said that it published the\nstory to help Mr Moran with his appeal for information and to generate support\nfor the family via the Just Giving appeal. \n7.     The\nnewspaper also said that the personal details of the family included in the\narticle were all in the public domain, as they had appeared in the Facebook\npost that the complainant had made public, and which, by the complainant’s own\nadmission had gone viral and been “shared thousands of times.” \n8.    The\nnewspaper did not accept that it had breached the Code but apologised for the\nupset caused to the complainant and his family. \nRelevant Code\nprovisions \n9.  Clause\n2 (Privacy) * \n(i)    Everyone\nis entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and\ncorrespondence, including digital communications. \n(ii)   Editors’\nwill be expected to justify intrusions into any individual’s private life\nwithout consent. Account will be taken of the complainant’s own public\ndisclosures of information. \nClause 4\n(Intrusion into grief or shock) * \nIn cases\ninvolving personal grief or shock, enquiries and approaches must be made with\nsympathy and discretion and publication handled sensitively. These provisions\nshould not restrict the right to report legal proceedings. \nClause 6\n(Children) * \n(i)    All\npupils should be free to complete their time at school without unnecessary\nintrusion. \nClause 9\n(Reporting of Crime) * \n(i)    Relatives\nor friends of persons convicted or accused of crime should not generally be\nidentified without their consent, unless they are genuinely relevant to the\nstory. \n(ii)   Particular\nregard should be paid to the potentially vulnerable position of children who\nwitness, or are victims of, crime. This should not restrict the right to report\nlegal proceedings. \nFindings of\nthe Committee \n10. The Committee\nfirst considered the publication of the complainant and his partner’s names,\nand acknowledged that this had come at a distressing time for the complainant.\nThe complainant said that by identifying himself, his partner and their\ndaughter, the publication had breached their right to privacy; however this was\ninformation the complainant placed in the public domain as part of a public\nstatement appealing for information. Its inclusion in the article did not\nrepresent a breach of Clause 2. \n11. The Committee then\nturned to the complaint under Clause 2 and Clause 6 regarding the naming of the\ncomplainant’s daughter. The complainant had published a Facebook post, which\nhad included within it a photograph, taken by someone else, which contained a\ncaption that had included his daughter’s name. This post, by the complainant's\nown admission, had “gone viral” and been “shared thousands of times.” The\nnewspaper had not published any information about his daughter apart from her\nname and the fact she was the complainant’s daughter. In these circumstances\nthe Committee did not consider that publication of the complainant’s daughter’s\nfirst name represented a failure to respect her private life, or was an\nunnecessary intrusion into her time at school. There was no breach of Clause 2\nor Clause 6. \n12.  Given the\nserious nature of this crime, and the public appeal for information by the\npolice, the newspaper and where the complainant had made a public comment via\nFacebook, the publication of the names of the individuals involved did not\nrepresent a failure to handle publication sensitively. The newspaper was also\nnot obliged to obtain the consent of the complainant prior to publication.\nThere was no breach of Clause 4. \n13. Clause 9 relates\nto the identification of family and friends of individuals convicted or accused\nof crime. There was no breach of Clause 9. \nConclusion \n14. The complaint was\nnot upheld \nRemedial\naction required \nN/A\nDate complaint received: 16/04/2017\nDate decision issued: 26/06/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
