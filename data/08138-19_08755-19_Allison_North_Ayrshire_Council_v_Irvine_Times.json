Gail\nAllison, represented by the North Ayrshire Council, complained to the\nIndependent Press Standards Organisation that the Irvine Times breached Clause\n1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Man’s\nlife ‘ruined’ after NAC staff accused him of stalking”, published on 15 October\n2019.\n2. The\narticle was a first-person account by a man who had faced charges under\nsections 38 and 39 of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010\nand who “claim[ed] his life has been ruined after North Ayrshire Council\nemployees accused him of stalking”. It focussed on this man’s feelings after\nbeing accused of stalking, and what had happened in his personal life. The\narticle detailed that the man “spent three weeks in prison… after being accused\nof stalking two former colleagues”, and included a quote from him in which he\nstated that he had lost everything because of “this” and had “spent three weeks\non remand in prison” as well as losing his home, car and being sacked from his\njob at the Council. The article reported that “a Sheriff dramatically threw out\nall the stalking charges” and that he had then been “found guilty of a much\nlesser breach of the peace charge” after “posting an offensive message… on his\nsocial media page” about one of the women who had accused him of stalking. It\nincluded several quotations from the man about his experience, including him\nsaying that he felt that he was “the one who was victimised here” and that,\nafter all but one of the charges against him were dropped, that those who made\nthe allegations against him should face “justice”. The article also detailed\nthe penalties the man faced as a result of the accusations: he was “fined £100\nand ordered to pay the woman £500 compensation for the offensive Facebook post\nand ordered not to contact her”.\n3. The\narticle also appeared online in substantially the same format headlined “Man’s\nlife ‘ruined’ after council staff accused him of stalking”, published on 18\nOctober 2019.\n4. The\ncomplainant was one of the women who the man was accused of stalking. During\nIPSO’s investigation, she was represented by her employer, North Ayrshire\nCouncil. She said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. She\nsaid that the man had gone to prison because he had breached his bail\nconditions; the breach of bail was a separate matter to the stalking charges.\nShe said that the article was misleading as it implied a causal link between\nthe stalking charges and the man’s time in prison.  She also said it was misleading to report\nthat all the stalking charges against him had been thrown out as the charge he\nwas convicted of related to conduct that the complainant considered to be\nstalking and harassment. The complainant also said it was misleading to\ncharacterise the section 38 breach of the peace charge for which the man was\nfound guilty as a “much lesser” charge than the section 39 charge of stalking\nhe had been accused of. She said that the conviction was still very serious,\nand the social media activity which was the basis for the conviction involved\nserious threats. The complainant also stated that he had been charged with\nrepeated offences, but was eventually found guilty in respect of one single\noccasion.\n5. The\ncomplainant also said that the man had not been sacked by the council, but had\nresigned, and that his job title was reported inaccurately. However, she did\nnot say what his job title was. She also disputed that he had been victimised\nand that nothing had happened to his accusers. She also said that the article\nwas unbalanced, as it portrayed the man as having his life ruined without\ndemonstrating the seriousness of his offences. Finally, she said that the\narticle was misleading as it did not include the fact that the man was also now\nbanned by the court from entering Council premises for 3 years and was required\nto attend a number of programs. \n6. The\npublication did not accept a breach of the Code. It said that the article was\nnot a detailed law report of the court case, but the man’s first-hand account\nof his experience. It said that the man was entitled to talk about his\nexperiences, and the article was clearly presented as his account, rather than\nas a court report. Whilst the complainant may disagree with the man’s views,\nthat did not mean they could not be published or that the article was\ninaccurate. It also said that the complainant was wrong to suggest there was\nnot a connection between the man’s time in prison and the stalking allegations\nas if he had not been charged with stalking, he would not have had bail imposed\nupon him which he then went on to breach. The publication said that it was not\nmisleading to report that all stalking charges had been thrown out where he had\noriginally been charged with nine incidents under section 39 but was only\nconvicted of one offence under section 38 (breach of the peace). Furthermore,\nthe publication also said it was not misleading to describe the section 38\ncharge as being “much lesser” than the section 39 charge and noted that the\nman’s own solicitor had said that he had been convicted on “a much reduced\ncharge”. It said the seriousness of a section 39 or section 38 charge would depend\non the conduct, however the maximum penalty for a section 38 charge was five\nyears in prison on indictment or a year on remand.  As the man received a fine and all the\ncharges under section 39 were dropped, the publication said that this was\nfurther evidence that the court convicted him of a less serious charge.\n7. The\npublication said that it was not misleading to report that the man had been\nsacked. Prior to publication it had contacted the Council, who had sent an\nemail asking if the main issue was “That we were wrong to sack him?” The\npublication did not consider any inaccuracy in the reporting of the man’s job\ntitle to be significant to the overall article. However, it did offer to\ncorrect both the man’s job title and the reason for dismissal if the complainant\nwas able to provide the material showing the correct position. It said that the\narticle had also included several of the penalties the man was subject to and\nthat other penalties, including the requirement that he attend a number of\nprograms, were sanctions from the breach of bail, rather than the section 38\nconviction; the article made clear that it was referring to penalties imposed\n“for the Facebook post”. It said that the only detail it had not included from\nthe section 38 conviction was that his restraining order also applied to\ncouncil properties, but this was not significantly misleading as to the overall\narticle. Finally, the publication said that it had put the man’s comments on\nhis experience to the Council prior to publication, including his view that he\nspent 3 weeks in prison “over the charges which were thrown out” and the\nCouncil had declined to provide any comment or rebuttal.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\n8. Clause\n1 (Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n9. The\narticle was a subjective first-hand account of the man’s experience of the\ncriminal justice system, which the newspaper was entitled to publish, provided\nit took care to avoid inaccuracy in line with its obligations under the terms\nof Clause 1. Notwithstanding this, the Committee acknowledged that the article\nhad caused the complainant distress, and reported on matters which were also\ndeeply personal to her.   \n10. The\nCommittee noted the complainant’s concerns that the article had not specified\nthat the man had gone to prison for three weeks because he had breached his\nbail conditions, rather than being sentenced to prison as a result of the\nallegations of stalking. However, the article did not report that the time\nspent in prison was directly as a result of the allegations. It set out the\nman’s account of what had happened after the allegations against him had been\nmade and included a quote from him in which he said that he had been on remand\nin prison “because of this”. The article accurately reported the offences for\nwhich the man had been convicted and the penalties he had received for those\noffences. Where the time the man spent in prison was part of a chain of events\nwhich followed the allegations being made, it was not misleading to report that\nhe had spent three weeks in prison after the allegations against him had been\nmade, or to include a quote from the man in which he expressed the view that\nhis imprisonment had occurred “because of this”. On this basis there was no\nfailure to take care under Clause 1(i) on this point, and no significant\ninaccuracy as to require correction under Clause (ii).\n11. The\ncharge the man faced under section 39 of the 2010 Act (Offence of stalking)\ninvolved 9 incidents and the charge he faced under section 38 (Threatening or\nabusive behaviour) involved one incident. It was not in dispute that the man\nwas convicted under section 38 and not under section 39. Where he had been\nconvicted of an offence only under section 38, it was not inaccurate for the\narticle to report that the stalking charges against him had been thrown out.\nThere was no breach of Clause 1 on this point. The article had also referred to\nthe complainant as being convicted of a “much lesser” breach of the peace\ncharge after all the stalking charges had been thrown out by the Sheriff. In\ncircumstances where the man was acquitted of the charge under section 39 which\ninvolved multiple incidents and was convicted under section 38 in relation to a\nsingle incident, it was not significantly misleading to report that the man had\nbeen convicted of a “much lesser” breach of the peace charge. There was no\nfailure to take care on this point, and no breach of Clause 1.\n12. The\ncomplainant had said that the man had not been fired from his job, but that he\nhad resigned. The publication had relied on an email sent by a council employee\nwhich had suggested that they had ended the man's employment. On this basis\nthere was no failure to take care under Clause 1(i), and the complainant had\nnot provided any evidence to suggest that the information contained in the\nemail was inaccurate. In addition, the complainant had said that the man’s job\ntitle had been reported inaccurately, but without indicating his correct\ntitle.  As it was not in dispute that the\nman had previously been employed by the Council, and without evidence of the\nman’s job title, the Committee did not find a breach of Clause 1 on this point.\nThe publication had offered to publish a clarification on each of these points\nif it was demonstrated that they were inaccurate, which the Committee welcomed.\n13. The\ncomplainant had said that the article had made the man out to be the victim and\nlacked balance. Under the Editors’ Code, articles do not need to be balanced,\nas long as publications take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or\ndistorted information. Therefore there was no breach of Clause 1 on these\npoints.\n14.\nFinally, the article had reported that the man was fined £100 and ordered to\npay the woman £500 compensation for the offensive Facebook post and ordered not\nto contact her. The article made clear that these penalties related to the\noffensive Facebook post only, and where the article had also reported that he\nwas subject to restrictions which precluded the man from contacting the\ncomplainant, it was not significantly misleading to omit to report that the\nrestraining order to which the man was subject also covered council properties.\nOn this basis, there was no failure to take care under Clause 1(i) and no\nsignificant inaccuracy requiring correction under Clause 1(ii).\nConclusions\n15. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n15. N/A\n \nDate\ncomplaint received: 11/11/19\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 21/10/20\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
