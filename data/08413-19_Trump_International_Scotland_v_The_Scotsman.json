Trump International Scotland complained to the\nIndependent Press Standards Organisation that The Scotsman breached Clause 1\n(Accuracy), Clause 3 (Harassment) and Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and\nsubterfuge) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Trumps\n‘frustrated’ by foreign projects ban”, published on 26 October 2019.\n2. The article reported on a meeting hosted at a\n“controversial” evangelical church in Glasgow, in which the Executive Vice\nPresident of Trump International Scotland and her husband – who researched a\nbook about President Trump – addressed approximately 120 people in an event\ndescribed as a “rare address” and a “rare public speaking engagement” for the\nExecutive Vice President. It explained that attendees could also buy a copy of\nthe man’s book. It gave details of the speeches made by these two individuals,\nincluding their views on the President Donald Trump and his business dealings\nin Scotland. It reported that the Executive Vice President of the business said\nthat President Trump’s personal “liberties and freedoms” had been curtailed\nbecause he could not visit his Scottish properties to play golf when he likes.\nIt went on to quote the Executive Vice President in full: “It’s frustrating for\nthe family, because they’re business people, so the presidency is... and also\nhis liberties and his freedoms to be able to come and play golf when he wants”.\nThe article also reported that the Executive Vice President told the event that\n“everybody in the Trump Organisation is going to write a book”, and included\nher full quote: “’Everybody in the Trump Organisation is going to write a\nbook,’ she said. ‘Everybody’s writing a book about Trump whether they’re in the\norganisation or not’”.\n3. “The article also appeared online on 25 October 2019 with\nthe headline “Trumps ‘frustrated’ at inability to pursue ‘foreign investment’\ndeals, says Trump Org executive”. This article was more substantial than the\nprint counterpart and gave much more information about what was said at the\nevent by the Executive Vice President. It explained that this was understood to\nbe the first time that any employee of the Trump Organisation, other than\nPresident Trump’s adult children, had given a public address since he became\nPresident. It also reported that the Executive Vice President and her husband\nshared “numerous private photographs” at the event, including images of the man\ndining with President Trump in the White House.\n4. The online article also included information about the\nevangelical church which hosted the event, giving details of “contentious”\nspeakers it had hosted, and its relationship with two other named churches.\n5. The complainant was represented by the Executive Vice\nPresident of Trump International Scotland, who had spoken at the event and\nwhose comments were reported in the article. The representative said that she\nwas unaware of the presence of the reporter at the event and established\npost-publication that the reporter had gained access via a false name and email\naddress and had audio recorded the event. She said that there was no public\ninterest in doing this, or in publishing the remarks she made at the event –\ntherefore, the actions of the reporter and the publication of her comments\nbreached Clause 10. She said that she found the reporter’s actions insulting\nand distressing as having taken place in a church, and she said that the event\nwas only for church members and friends interested in discussing their lives\nand careers within the context of their faith – she said that it not a public\nevent. She said that she could have been approached directly and had previously\ndealt with media inquiries on behalf of the business, and that it appeared from\ncorrespondence she had seen that the reporter had acted without the knowledge\nof senior editorial staff.  \n6. The complainant’s representative also said that the\narticle was inaccurate. She said that the comment she made about President\nTrump’s personal liberties and freedoms being “curtailed” was in reference to\nhis life in general as President, not solely about “playing golf”. She said\nthat the comment about “everyone writing a book” was made in jest and referred\nspecifically to her husband who had written a book about President Trump. She\nsaid that the business was not given a right of reply, and it was not the case\nthat this was the first speaking engagement by a Trump Executive since\nPresident Trump assumed office – for example, she said that the she had\nrecently addressed Aberdeenshire Council at a major public committee meeting\nabout the Trump Organisation’s business in Scotland. She also said that the\nimages shown at the event were not “private” as they had already been published\nelsewhere.\n7. The complainant’s representative also said that the\narticle contained several inaccuracies about the church that hosted the event,\nincluding the article’s claim that it was “controversial” and had hosted\n“contentious” speakers. She also said that the article had inaccurately reported\nits relations with two other named churches, and some of the church’s\nteachings. Finally, she also said that the article had inaccurately reported\ndetails of the church’s finances.\n8. The complainant’s representative also said that the\nattendance of the journalist at the event and his general coverage of Trump\nInternational Scotland constituted a breach of Clause 3. She said that he\nappeared to have an “agenda” against Trump International Scotland, and\nfrequently criticised it on his social media accounts. She said that this had\nled to him being blocked by several of the business’ Twitter accounts due his\n“relentless negative and sarcastic remarks”.\n9. The publication did not accept that there was any breach\nof the Code. It accepted that Clause 10(ii) was engaged to a limited degree,\nbut said that there was a sufficient public interest to justify the behaviour\nof the reporter. It said that the reporter understood it to be the first time\nthat any employee of the Trump Organisation had given a public address in\nScotland since Donald Trump was elected President, and it was considered\nnecessary for the reporter to attend and record proceedings in order to ensure\nthat the event was accurately reported. It was also advertised as an event in\nwhich the speakers would discuss their recollections of working with President\nTrump. It said that the reporter was experienced in reporting on Trump\nInternational Scotland’s activities, and as a result, had been blocked on\nsocial media by the business, and had been told by the husband of the\nrepresentative that he had “no interest in talking to [named reporter] for any\nfuture articles”. It said that as such, it was reasonable to assume that if the\nreporter had taken an open approach, he would not have been granted admittance\nto the event.\n10. The publication said that the reporter discussed his\nplans for attending the event with a senior member of editorial staff: the news\neditor. The event was ticketed but open to the general public; the journalist\nused a false name to book the tickets, but the newspaper said that at the event\nhe was not challenged or took any steps to disguise his identity.\n11. The publication\ndid not accept that the article included any significant inaccuracies. It said\nthat the article reported that it was “understood” that the event was the first\ntime an employee of Trump International – aside from President Trump’s children\n– had given a public address since he assumed office. It said it was unaware of\nthe representative or any other Trump employees having appeared as a key note\nspeaker at a public event in this time – taking part in a council debate on a\nspecific issue was clearly different in nature to a ticketed public speaking\nevent.\n12. The publication did not accept that this information it\nhad reported about the church was inaccurate, namely the claims that it was\ncontroversial and had hosted contentious speakers. It also said that the\narticle had accurately reported its relationship with two other named churches,\nits teachings, and details of the church’s finances.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n13. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\n14. Clause 3* (Harassment)\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\niii)  Editors must\nensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care\nnot to use non-compliant material from other sources.\n15. Clause 10* (Clandestine devices and subterfuge)\ni) The press must not seek to obtain or publish material\nacquired by using hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices; or by\nintercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails; or by the\nunauthorised removal of documents or photographs; or by accessing\ndigitally-held information without consent.\nii) Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including\nby agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public\ninterest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.\n*The Public Interest\nThere may be exceptions to the clauses marked * where they\ncan be demonstrated to be in the public interest.\n1. The public interest includes, but is not confined to:\nDetecting or exposing crime, or the threat of crime, or\nserious impropriety.Protecting public health or safety.Protecting the public from being misled by an action or\nstatement of an individual or organisation.Disclosing a person or organisation’s failure or likely\nfailure to comply with any obligation to which they are subject.Disclosing a miscarriage of justice.Raising or contributing to a matter of public debate,\nincluding serious cases of impropriety, unethical conduct or incompetence\nconcerning the public.Disclosing concealment, or likely concealment, of any of the\nabove.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. There is a public interest in freedom of expression\nitself.\n3. The regulator will consider the extent to which material\nis already in the public domain or will become so.\n4. Editors invoking the public interest will need to\ndemonstrate that they reasonably believed publication - or journalistic\nactivity taken with a view to publication – would both serve, and be\nproportionate to, the public interest and explain how they reached that\ndecision at the time.\n5. An exceptional public interest would need to be\ndemonstrated to over-ride the normally paramount interests of children under\n16.\nFindings of the Committee\n16. The reporter had accessed the event in a journalistic\ncapacity, for the purposes of writing an article. In doing so, he had obtained\na ticket using a false name and the attendees were under the impression that he\nwas a member of the public. As such, the terms of Clause 10(ii) were engaged.\nThe reporter had then reported comments made at the event by the complainant’s\nrepresentative in her capacity as an employee of Trump International Scotland.\n17. The Committee considered that the level of subterfuge or\nmisrepresentation a reporter may engage in falls on a sliding scale. In this\ninstance, there was a public interest in reporting on the event, and this was\ndiscussed at senior editorial level with the news editor before the reporter\nhad attended: the representative and other high profile speakers would be discussing\ntheir experience of working with the President of the United States, Donald\nTrump, and his business dealings in Scotland. It was reasonable for the\nreporter to have assumed that an open approach would not have been successful;\nhe was known to the complainant and other speakers at the event as having\nwritten previously about Trump International and had been blocked by them on\ntheir social media accounts. The representative’s husband named the journalist\nspecifically as someone he had “no interest in talking to”. In attending the\nevent, the reporter had engaged in a very low level of misrepresentation; he\nhad used a false email address and name to obtain a ticket to an event which\nwas open to the public and which promoted the representative’s husband’s book.\nHe had not accessed any information that was not available to any member of the\npublic in attendance at the event. The action taken by the reporter was\nproportionate to the public interest served by reporting on the event. There\nwas a public interest in publishing the comments made at the event, including\nthe comments made by the representative as set out in the article; they related\nto the business dealings of President Trump and the activities of Trump\nInternational in Scotland. For all of these reasons, there was no breach of\nClause 10(ii).\n18. The Committee then considered the representative’s\nconcern that the reporter had used a clandestine listening device, and whether\nthe terms of Clause 10(i) were engaged. The Committee was mindful of the\nrequirement of Clause 1(i) to take care over the accuracy of information which\nis reported and recognised the benefit of creating an accurate, contemporaneous\nrecord of events. In this instance, the Committee considered that the audio\nrecording had been made to serve as a contemporaneous record of what was said\nat a public meeting of approximately 120 people; the reporter could have\nachieved the same ends by making notes of proceedings. The audio recording\nequipment was not being used as a covert recording device to obtain\nconfidential information, and the only subterfuge was in using a false email\naddress and name in order to gain access to the event. As such, the Committee\nconsidered that the reporter did not use a clandestine listening device, and\nthe terms of Clause 10(i) were not engaged.\n19. The representative did not dispute that the article had\nquoted her full comments accurately – the question for the Committee was\nwhether the summary of these comments included in the article was significantly\nmisleading. It was apparent from the full quotes included in the article that\nthe representative had said that she believes that the fact that President\nDonald Trump was unable to play golf when he wants was an example of how his\nfreedom and liberties had been curtailed by his presidency. Similarly, the\nrepresentative did say that “everyone” would be writing a book about the\nPresident – the fact that she considered this comment to be in jest did not\nmean that the newspaper reported these comments inaccurately by reporting them\nin full. The article took care over the reporting of the representative’s\ncomments, and there was no breach of Clause 1(i) or any significant inaccurate\nrequiring correction under the terms of Clause 1(ii).\n20. The online article reported that it was “believed” that\nthe event was the first public address by a senior employee of Trump\nInternational Scotland – apart from the President’s own children – since the\nPresident assumed office. This was not a categorical claim that no senior employee\nhad given such an address, but that this was the reporter’s own understanding.\nThe publication explained that the reporter was unable to find similar events\nhosted by the complainant, and furthermore, the representative did not say that\nshe had engaged in similar public addresses to ticketed audiences where she was\nthe keynote speaker, discussing her experience of working alongside President\nTrump. As such, there was a basis to report in the online article that it was\n“believed” to be the case that the event was the first such public address by a\nsenior employee of Trump International Scotland. There was no failure to take\ncare over the accuracy of the article in reporting this, and no breach of\nClause 1(i). The Committee recognised the representative’s position that she\nhad spoken previously as a representative of the complainant. However, it\nconsidered that even if it were the case that she had given a similar address\nto a ticketed audience, discussing her recollections of working alongside President\nTrump, the Committee considered that reporting that the event at the church was\n“believed” to be the first of its kind, did not give rise to any significant\ninaccuracy as to the content and nature of the event. There was no significant\ninaccuracy on this point requiring correction under Clause 1(ii). The Committee\nconsidered that describing photographs as being “private” did not necessarily\nmean that they were not in the public domain and could also refer to the fact\nthat they were owned and shared by the representative and her husband. There\nwas no failure to take care over the accuracy of the article in describing the\nphotographs as private, and no significant inaccuracy on this point requiring\ncorrection under the terms of Clause 1(ii).\n21. In regards to the complainant’s concerns about the\naccuracy of the information reported about the church which hosted the event,\nthe Committee had regard to IPSO’s regulations, which state that IPSO is able\nto consider complaints from an individual who has been personally and directly\naffected by the alleged breach of the Editors’ Code of Practice; complaints\nfrom a representative group affected by an alleged breach where there is a\nsubstantial public interest; and complaints from third parties about accuracy.\nIn the case of third party complaints, IPSO needs to consider the position of\nthe party most closely involved.\n22. In this case, these particular alleged inaccuracies\nrelated directly to the church which hosted the event, and in order to make a\ndecision on whether the Code was breached, it would have been necessary for the\nCommittee to make published findings on the extent to which the church or its\nspeakers had attracted controversy; the church’s relationships with other\nchurches; its teaching and views, and its finances. This could have an effect\non the public profile and reputation of the church, and the Committee was\nconcerned about making such a ruling without the church’s involvement in IPSO’s\ninvestigation into this complaint, and without its consent. For these reasons,\nit was not appropriate for the Committee to make a finding on this aspect of\nthe complaint.  \n23. The Editors’ Code makes clear that publications are free\nto be partisan, biased, and take a view on a particular issue, as long as the\ncode is not otherwise breached. Newspapers are also free to select which\nsubjects to cover or how much coverage to give an issue. The representative had\nnot said that the reporter had acted in a way which was intimidating or\nharassing, or had failed to respect a request to desist from contacting the\ncomplainant or its representative directly – indeed the representative had\nargued that the reporter should have made a direct approach to the business, as\nopposed to engaging in misrepresentation in order to attend the event.  As such, the fact that the reporter had\nwritten several articles critical of Trump International Scotland, or had\ncriticised it on social media, did not engage to the terms of Clause 3.\nConclusions\n24. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n25. N/A\n \nDate complaint received: 30/10/2019\nDate complaint concluded: 28/05/2020\nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review.\n \n\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
