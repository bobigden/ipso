A woman complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that thesun.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2\n(Privacy), Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief and shock), Clause 5 (Reporting of\nsuicide) and Clause 6 (Children) of the Editors' Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “’HE MADE A SAD BOY SO HAPPY' Emotional moment Steven Gerrard\nFaceTimes lad after youngster’s dad’s tragic death” published on 11 July 2019.\n2. The article reported on a phone call made by former\nfootballer Steven Gerrard to a child whose father had died the previous year.\nThe article reported that the child’s father had died of cancer.\n3. The complainant, the mother of the man who died, said\nthat the article inaccurately reported her son’s cause of death. She also said\nthat this error had caused great distress and upset to the family.\n4. The publication accepted that they had inaccurately\nreported the man’s cause of death. It said it had amended the article to remove\nthe cause of death after it became aware of the error on the same day that the\narticle was published. The error had originated from a third party news site\nthat was the source of the information.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported\nby the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2 (Privacy)*\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nClause 3 (Harassment)*\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\niii)  Editors must\nensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care\nnot to use non-compliant material from other sources.\nClause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings.\nClause 5 (Reporting Suicide)*\nWhen reporting suicide, to prevent simulative acts care\nshould be taken to avoid excessive detail of the method used, while taking into\naccount the media's right to report legal proceedings.\nClause 6 (Children)*\ni) All pupils should be free to complete their time at\nschool without unnecessary intrusion.\nii) They must not be approached or photographed at school\nwithout permission of the school authorities.\niii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or\nphotographed on issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a\ncustodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.\niv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material\ninvolving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their\nchildren or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.\nMediated Outcome\n6. The complaint was not resolved during the referral\nperiod. IPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter.\n7. During IPSO’s investigation, the matter was settled\nbetween the parties.\n8. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 22/10/2019\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 12/12/2019\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
