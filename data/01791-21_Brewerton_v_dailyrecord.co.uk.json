The article was predominantly based on the comments of\none of the meeting participants, and included a thirty-second clip of the\nmeeting.\n3.\nThe complainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. He\nfirst said that the video of the meeting included with the article had been\naltered, with sequences changed and interactions omitted. He said that these\nalterations meant that the video was not an accurate or correct record of what\nhad happened during the meeting.  He also\nsaid that he considered the article to be inaccurate as it condoned the actions\nof Jackie Weaver, and he considered that her actions had been improper.\n4.\nThe complainant also considered that the video included in the article breached\nClause 2, as he appeared in the video and said that he had not been informed at\nthe time that the meeting was being recorded. Both complainants had been in\ntheir home when the video was recorded, therefore the complainant said that the\nuse of the video intruded on their private life; they did accept, however, that\nthe video had been uploaded to Youtube prior to the article’s publication. The\ncomplainant further noted that, while the public were able to watch the\nmeeting, this was via a link only, and approximately 5 to 6 members of the\npublic attended the meeting.\n5.\nThe complainant also said that he considered that Clause 3 had been breached by\nthe article, as it included material which was not compliant with the terms of\nthe Clause; namely, the video, which he considered had been recorded illegally.\n6.\nTurning to Clause 4, the complainant said that he considered this Clause had\nbeen breached as he did not consider that publication of the article had been\nhandled sensitively. He believed that the publication should have been more\nsensitive, where the viral video had led to great shock amongst his close and\nextended family.\n7.\nThe complainant then said that he considered that the use of the video breached\nClause 10, as he believed it had been recorded illegally on a secondary device,\nsuch as an iPad; he said he knew this was the case as had it been recorded\ndirectly from a computer, it would have shown a recording logo and there wasn’t\none present in the video. He said that the press had a duty to ensure the video\nhad not been recorded illegally, and that it had not done so in this case.\n8.\nThe publication said it did not accept that the article breached the Editors’\nCode. It said that the accuracy of the video could be supported both by viewing\nthe full video of the meeting – which was publicly available and showed the\nevents of the meeting – and the council’s minutes of the meeting. It did not\naccept, therefore, that the video could be said to be inaccurate.\n9.\nTurning to the complainants’ Clause 2 and Clause 10 concerns, it noted that the\nvideo was both publicly available and viral at the time of the article’s\npublication, and that the council’s meeting minutes made clear that a recording\nof the meeting could be made available on request. The publication also said\nthat it could not comment on how the video was recorded, as it was not in a\nposition to know the circumstances in which the recording was made; it also,\ntherefore, could not be said to have sought to obtain a video recorded by a\nhidden camera. With these factors in mind, it did not accept that the article\nor video could represent a breach of Clause 2 or Clause 10.\n10.\nThe publication did not accept that the complainants’ concerns framed under\nClause 4 engaged the terms of the Clause, where the article under complaint did\nnot relate to a case of grief or shock.\n11.\nThe complainant said that the publication could not rely on the published\nminutes pf the meeting to support its position that the video was available to\nthe public, as the minutes were inaccurate.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause\n1 (Accuracy)\ni)\nThe Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii)\nA significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii)\nA fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv)\nThe Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause\n2 (Privacy)*\ni)\nEveryone is entitled to respect for their private and family life, home,\nphysical and mental health, and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii)\nEditors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private\nlife without consent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy, account will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of\ninformation and the extent to which the material complained about is already in\nthe public domain or will become so.\niii)\nIt is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public\nor private places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nClause\n3 (Harassment)*\ni)\nJournalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit.\nii)\nThey must not persist in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing\nindividuals once asked to desist; nor remain on property when asked to leave\nand must not follow them. If requested, they must identify themselves and whom\nthey represent.\n \niii)  Editors must ensure these principles are\nobserved by those working for them and take care not to use non-compliant\nmaterial from other sources.\nClause\n4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn\ncases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and approaches must be made\nwith sympathy and discretion and publication handled sensitively. These\nprovisions should not restrict the right to report legal proceedings.\nClause\n10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge)\ni)\nThe press must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by using hidden\ncameras or clandestine listening devices; or by intercepting private or mobile\ntelephone calls, messages or emails; or by the unauthorised removal of\ndocuments or photographs; or by accessing digitally-held information without\nconsent.\nii)\nEngaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or\nintermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then\nonly when the material cannot be obtained by other means.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n12.\nThe Committee noted first that it was not in dispute that the thirty-second\nclip of the meeting included with the article was an excerpt from the recording\nof the meeting. It was clear from the description of the meeting included in\nthe text of the article that it was only an excerpt, rather than an unedited\nrecording of the meeting in full, and that it had been included as an\nillustration of some of the exchanges which had taken place during the meeting.\nIn these circumstances, the Committee did not consider that the publication of\nthe video in this format was significantly inaccurate, misleading, or\ndistorted; there was no breach of Clause 1\n13.  While the Committee understood that the\ncomplainant had concerns that the article condoned the actions of Ms Weaver, it\nnoted that concerns that articles are biased or one-sided do not – in and of\nthemselves – engage the terms of the Editors’ Code. As such, there was no\nbreach of the Clause 1 on this point.\n14.\nThe terms of Clause 2 make clear that, when considering individual’s reasonable\nexpectation of privacy, account will be taken of the extent to which the\ninformation complained of is in the public domain. In this instance, the\ncomplainant considered that the video included in the article – showing him and\nhis son in their home – breached the terms of the Clause. However, the video\nshowed proceedings at a public meeting held by a public body. Further, the\nvideo was available on YouTube at the time of the article’s publication, and\nhad been viewed well over a million times. In these circumstances, the\nCommittee did not consider that the complainant had a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy over the video. There was, therefore, no breach of Clause 2.\n15.\nThe complainant had not alleged that the publication, or anyone working on its\nbehalf, engaged in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit; furthermore,\nthe complainant had not said that he had been approached by a journalist\nworking for the publication who persisted in questioning, telephoning, pursuing\nor photographing him or his son once asked to desist. For this reason, the\nCommittee found that there was no breach of Clause 3.\n16.\nWhile the Committee understood that the video going “viral” had caused distress\nto the complainant, it noted that the terms of Clause 4 generally relate to\ncases involving bereavement, injury, and crime. Where the content of the\narticle under complaint related to a parish council meeting, the Committee did\nnot consider that the article related to the complainant’s personal grief or\nshock, and there was no breach of Clause 4.\n17.\nThe terms of Clause 10 make clear that the press should not seek to publish\nmaterial obtained by using hidden cameras; the purpose of the Clause is to\nregulate the publication and acquisition of material obtained using clandestine\ndevices and misrepresentation. In this case, the publication did not know\nexactly how the video had been recorded; however, neither party disputed that\nat the time the article was published, the video was widely available in the\npublic domain. The basis advanced by the complainant for claiming the video had\nbeen obtained using a clandestine recording device was that it appeared not to\nhave been recorded using the internal recording in the computer programme used\nto host the virtual meeting. While the Committee could not establish with\ncertainty how the meeting was recorded, it did not agree that the use of a\nsecondary device to make the recording amounted to a “clandestine” device for\nthe purposes of Clause 10. The video depicted a publicly accessible meeting,\nand whether it had been recorded using an in-program recording function or a\nsecondary recording device had no bearing on the content of the video. Explicit\nreference was made in the course of the meeting to the fact it was being\nrecorded, when a participant referred to a copy being sent to a monitoring\nofficer. Furthermore, the minutes of the meeting stated that a recording of the\nmeeting was available. The Committee did not, therefore, consider that the\npublication engaged in any form of subterfuge or misrepresentation in the\nrecording of the meeting.\n18.  Furthermore, at the time the article was\npublished, the video from which the clip was extracted was widely circulating\nin the public domain and had been viewed over one million times; the newspaper\nhad not, therefore, been engaged, either directly or through an agent, in\nmaking or procuring the recording. It could not therefore be said that the\nnewspaper had sought to obtain material obtained by using a hidden camera, and\nthere was breach of Clause 10.\nConclusion(s)\n19.\nThe complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n20.\nN/A\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 02/08/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 09/02/2022\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
