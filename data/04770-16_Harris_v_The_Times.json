Lian Harris\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The Times\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause 6 (Children) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Surrogate mother stalked\njudge who took child away”, published on 23 June 2016. \n2. The article\nreported on the complainant’s Magistrates’ Court sentencing hearing, where it\nsaid a 16-month suspended prison sentence was imposed for harassing a family\ncourt judge. It said that the complainant had agreed to be surrogate mother for\na couple, but later changed her mind to keep the baby; it said that the judge\nhad ruled that the child should stay with the couple, and had “feared for her\nlife” when the complainant had called to her door.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that her child was the subject of ongoing proceedings in the family court,\nand entitled by law to anonymity. She said that by publishing her name in the\ncourt report, the newspaper had identified her child, and breached her child’s\nright to privacy under Clause 2, as well as the terms of Clause 6.\n4. The complainant\nsaid that she had been sentenced to a 16-week suspended sentence, not a\n16-month suspended sentence. She said that it was inaccurate to report that she\nwas a surrogate mother, as the child was biologically hers. She also said that\nit was inaccurate to report that the judge had “feared for her life”, as this\nwas not mentioned in her witness statement.5. The newspaper\nsaid that it did not identify the child in the article. It said that if there\nwas any way that her child could be identified, it was because of the numerous\ndemonstrations and publicity activities the complainant had taken part in. It\nprovided photographs of these “stunts”, and highlighted the Facebook page the\ncomplainant had set up to support her fight to gain custody of her child, which\nincluded her child’s name.\n6. The newspaper\nsaid that it had been heard in court that the complainant was a surrogate\nmother. It accepted that it was inaccurate to report that she was given a\n16-month suspended sentence, but said that the failure to check every fact in a\nstory supplied by a reputable news agency did not represent a failure to take\ncare not to publish inaccurate information under Clause 1(i). In any event, it\nsaid that as soon as it became aware of the inaccuracy, it amended the story\nonline and published the following correction in the Corrections and\nClarifications column of the newspaper:\nLian Harris, who admitted harassing a family court judge,\nreceived a 16-week suspended sentence, not 16-months as we reported (News, June\n23).\nRelevant Code Provisions\n7.    Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\n(i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\n(ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual’s private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosures of information.\nClause 6 (Children)\ni) All pupils should be free to complete their time at\nschool without unnecessary intrusion.\nii) They must not be approached or photographed at school\nwithout permission of the school authorities.\niii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or\nphotographed on issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a\ncustodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.\niv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material\ninvolving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their\nchildren or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.\nv) Editors must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a\nparent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child's\nprivate life.\nFindings of the Committee\n8. The Editors’\nCode does not deal with the enforcement of reporting restrictions, or the right\nto anonymity provided for by statute; however, the Code may well be engaged\nwhen a reporting restriction, or right to anonymity, is in place. The article\ncontained no other detail which, even on the complainant’s account, might lead\nto the identification of her child, beyond the complainant’s name. Having\nregard for the full context of the case, including the effect of the\nproceedings on the child’s position, the Committee did not consider that\npublication of the complainant’s name was sufficient to identify the child.\nThere was no breach of Clause 2 or 6.  \n9. In circumstances\nwhere the complainant’s custodial sentence was suspended, the Committee did not\nconsider that the inaccuracy on the length of the suspended sentence imposed\nwas significant; there was no breach of Clause 1. Nonetheless, the Committee\nwelcomed the correction published by the newspaper.\n10. While the Committee noted the complainant’s position\nthat she was her daughter’s biological mother, in circumstances where the\ncomplainant did not dispute that she had been described in court as a\n“surrogate”, it was not misleading for the newspaper to use this term given the\nnature of proceedings in the family court, and the fact the article made clear\nthis remained the subject of dispute. In addition, where the judge had said in\nher witness statement that she was “alarmed” and “fearful” when the complainant\ncalled at her door, and said that the photograph published on the complainant’s\nFacebook page revealing her address exposed her to “other people who intend to\nharass and molest me – or worse”, it was not significantly misleading to\ncharacterise this as the judge “fearing for her life”. There was no breach of\nClause 1 on either point.\nConclusions\n11. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A\nDate complaint received: 10/07/2016Date decision issued: 07/11/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
