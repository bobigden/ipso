Anthony\nLustigman complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The\nTimes breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Israel approves dozens of settlements”, published in print\non 7 December 2016, and “Israel approves dozens of illegal settlements on West\nBank”, published online on 7 December 2016.\n2. The article\nreported that the Israeli Parliament had voted to approve thousands of homes\nbuilt illegally in the West Bank over the past 20 years. It went on to report\nthat “all of Israel’s settlements are illegal under international law”, but\nsaid that this bill focused on settlements “illegitimate even under Israeli law\nbecause they were built without authorisation”.\n3. The headline\naside, the online article was the same as the print version.4. The complainant\nsaid that it was inaccurate to report that “all of Israel’s settlements are illegal\nunder international law”; he said this was a matter of opinion, and had no\nlegal basis. He said that no properly constituted court, with jurisdiction, had\never decided on the legality or otherwise of the settlements. He said that the\nopinion of United Nations bodies, the International Committee of the Red Cross,\nand the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on this matter were not legally\nbinding. He also referred to a report from the Jerusalem Center for Public\nAffairs, which concluded that Israel is entitled, under international law, “to\ncontinue the settlement of the territories of Judea and Samira”.\n5. The newspaper\nsaid that since the settlements were first established, the international\ncommunity has been more or less unanimous in condemning them as “illegal” and\n“illegitimate”. It highlighted the advisory opinion issued by the ICJ to the UN\nGeneral Assembly which found that the settlements had been established “in\nbreach of international law”. It also said that the United Nations Security\nCouncil had declared the settlements to be in breach of the Fourth Geneva\nConvention. It referenced Security Council Resolution 446, which said that “the\npolicy and practices of Israel in establishing settlements in the Palestinian\nand other Arab territories occupied since 1967 have no legal validity”;\nResolution 452 which said “the policy of Israel in establishing settlements in\nthe occupied Arab territories has no legal validity and constitutes a violation\nof the Fourth Geneva Convention”; and Resolution 476 which said that “all\nlegislative and administration measures and actions taken by Israel, the\noccupying Power, which purport to alter the character and status of the Holy\nCity of Jerusalem have no legal validity and constitute a flagrant violation of\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention”.  \nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate\n— an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as\nrequired by the regulator.\nFindings of the Committee \n7. The newspaper\nhad principally relied on the ICJ advisory opinion on the Israeli settlements,\nwhich concluded that “the Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian\nTerritory (including East Jerusalem) have been established in breach of\ninternational law”, to support its position that the settlements were illegal.\nThe newspaper was entitled to take this as an authoritative source of\ninternational law, notwithstanding the complainant’s position that the decision\nwas not binding by virtue of it having been issued as part of the court’s\nadvisory jurisdiction. In relying on the court’s determination, as well as the\nresolutions passed by the Security Council of the United Nations, there was no\nbreach of Clause 1(i) on the newspaper’s part. Further, this was a sufficient\nbasis for describing the settlements as “illegal” under international law. In\nthe absence of any significant inaccuracy, there was no breach of Clause 1(ii).\nConclusions\n8. The complaint\nwas not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n9. N/A\nDate complaint received: 15/11/2016Date decision issued: 23/02/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
