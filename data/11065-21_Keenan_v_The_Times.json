Richard\nKeenan complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The\nTimes breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Black actress 'airbrushed' from Dune posters”, published on 27\nOctober 2021.\n2. The\narticle reported that the image of a black British actress was omitted from a\nposter promoting a US made film in China, noting that “adverts for the science-fiction\nepic [...] contain scant evidence” of the actress. It said that “the removal of\nthe actress”, who had featured prominently in the original US poster, was\nhighlighted by the China Africa Project, an organisation dedicated to exploring\nChina’s engagement with Africa, and quoted the organisation as saying she had\nbeen “airbrushed out”. The article noted the “absence of the actress” drew to\nmind previous examples where Hollywood studios had drawn criticism for\nappearing to censor film in order “to appease Beijing and gain access to the\ncountry’s lucrative market”.  The article\nreported that “Chinese state media claimed that the allegation of [the\nactress’s] removal was an attempted ‘smear’ by its enemies”, noting that the\nproducers of the film and the actress herself were yet to comment on the story.\nThe article included an image of the poster, alongside a separate image of the\nactress, with the caption: “[named actress] is omitted in Chinese posters”.\n3. The\narticle also appeared online under the headline “Hollywood ‘removes black\nactress’ from Dune poster in China”, with the text of the article stating that\n“according to reports, she has been removed for the promotion in the film in\nChina.” It said the removal was “first highlighted by” the China Africa\nProject.\n4. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1\n(Accuracy). The actress had not been removed, or “airbrushed”, from the\npromotional poster in China. He said that this story had been fabricated and could\nprovoke anti-Chinese sentiment.\n5. The\nnewspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. It said readers would have\nunderstood that it was reporting a claim, rather than making a statement of\nfact. It noted that the use of single quotation marks in the headline of both\nthe print and online articles indicated the status of the allegations made by\nthe China Africa Project – a point supported by the text of both versions of\nthe article. It added that both made clear that the Chinese state media had dismissed\nthe allegations as a “smear”.\n6. Notwithstanding\nthis, upon receipt of the complaint, the newspaper had contacted the China\nAfrica Project who accepted that the allegation was inaccurate and therefore\nwithdrew it. Accordingly, the newspaper removed the online article and\npublished the following wording in its established Corrections and\nClarifications column in print and online:\n“We\nreported an allegation from the China Africa Project that [a named] black\nBritish actress, had been removed from a poster promoting the film Dune in\nChina (World, Oct 27). The China Africa Project has withdrawn the allegation,\nwhich was false. Multiple posters, not all of which portrayed Duncan-Brewster,\nwere used to promote the film in both Chinese and English-language markets. We\nare happy to make this clear”.\n7. The\ncomplainant did not consider that the steps taken by the newspaper were sufficient.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n8. The\nnewspaper had relied on a claim which had been made by the China Africa\nProject. It acknowledged that it had subsequently proven to be untrue and that\nit had been withdrawn by the organisation. Nonetheless, it considered that the\narticle had not breached the Code because it had taken care to present the\nclaim only as an allegation which had been made by the China Africa Project.\nWhile the Committee acknowledged the publication’s position, having reviewed\nthe article in detail, it concluded that the article, taken as a whole, had\npresented the claim as fact.\n9. In\nsupport of its position, the publication had cited the use of quotation marks\naround “airbrushed” in the headline and the inclusion of the response of the\nChinese state media. The Committee recognised that quotations marks may be used\nin headlines for a variety of reasons, including to indicate that the article\nis reporting a claim which has been made by a third party. In this instance,\nhowever, it did not consider that the headline – taken on its own or in\nconjunction with the article – made sufficiently clear that the article was\nreporting a claim which had been made by the China Africa Project, rather than\nbeing a factual report. The response of the Chinese state media which had been\nincluded – that it was an attempted “smear” – did not adequately indicate that\nthe article was reporting a claim when the article was considered as a whole.\nThe text of the article reported that there was “scant evidence” of the actress\nin adverts for the film in China; that the removal of the actress from the poster\nhad been “highlighted” by the China Africa Project; that “the absence of the\nactress” brought to mind a previous occasion when the prominence of a black\nactor had been reduced in promotional material; and the caption of the image\nstated unequivocally that “[the actress] is omitted in Chinese posters”. By\nreporting the matter in this way, without taking further steps to verify the\naccuracy of the report, the publication had not taken care over the accuracy of\nthe article and had breached Clause 1 (i).\n10. In\nthe context of an article about censorship and in circumstances where the\nclaims made featured prominently and formed the central basis of the article,\nthis inaccuracy was significant and in order to avoid a breach of Clause 1\n(ii), a correction was required.\n11. In\ncontrast to the print article, the online version of the article had, in the\nview of the Committee, accurately presented the claims made by the China Africa\nProject as allegations; the headline used quotation remarks around the full phrase\n“removes black actress”, indicating more clearly that this was a claim, and the\ntext of the article stated prominently that “according to reports” the actress\nhad been removed from the poster. As such, there was no failure to take care in\nrelation to the presentation of these claims. Nonetheless, in circumstances\nwhere it was accepted that these allegations were inaccurate, and where this\nwas significant for the reasons outlined above, a correction was required in\norder to avoid a breach of Clause 1 (ii). \n\n12. The\nCommittee next considered whether the remedial action taken by the newspaper\nwas sufficient to meet the terms of Clause 1 (ii). Upon receipt of the\ncomplaint, and receiving confirmation that the allegations had been withdrawn\nby the organisation, the newspaper had removed the online article and published\na correction, in print and online. This correction made clear the inaccuracy\nand the true position. It was published promptly, once the publication was\naware of the inaccuracy, and its location, the publication’s established\nCorrections & Clarifications column, was sufficiently prominent. This\ncorrection was therefore sufficient to meet the terms of Clause 1 (ii).  There was no further breach of Clause 1\n(ii).  \nConclusion(s)\n13. The\ncomplaint was partially upheld under Clause 1.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n14. The\npublished correction put the correct position on record and was offered\npromptly and with due prominence. No further action was required.\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 28/10/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 22/04/2022\n\n\n\nIndependent\nComplaints Reviewer\nThe\ncomplainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process\nfollowed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent Complaints\nReviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold the request\nfor review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
