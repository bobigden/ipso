Jonathan Williams complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that The Sunday Times breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Scientists warn over\ndelaying second shot as patients face waiting until March”, published on 10\nJanuary 2021.\n2. The article reported on the UK Government’s decision to\nextend the interval between Covid-19 vaccines doses to 12 weeks. It stated that\nBioNTech and Pfizer had said that there was no evidence that their vaccines,\nwhich require two doses, were still protective if the second jab was given more\nthan three weeks after the first, and that “no other country had followed\nsuit”. The article reported that “leading scientists” – who were also described\nin the article as “experts” – had expressed concern that delaying the second\ndose of the vaccine could have a “catastrophic” impact on ending the pandemic.\n3. The article also appeared online in substantially the\nsame format under the headline: “Scientists warn over delaying second Covid\nshot as patients face waiting until March”.\n4. The complainant said the article was inaccurate and\nmisleading in breach of Clause 1 as it reported that “no other country had\nfollowed” the UK’s vaccination policy to extend the interval between doses. He\nsaid the placement of this particular assertion in the article had immediately\nfollowed a sentence outlining BioNTech and Pfizer’s position regarding the\nefficacy of their vaccinations if the interval between doses was extended\nfurther than three weeks, and consequently it gave the clear impression that no\ncountry apart from the UK had extended the interval beyond three weeks. The\ncomplainant cited the strategies introduced by Denmark and France which he\nsaid, at the time of publication, “already permitted a delay of up to six weeks\nbetween doses”. In order to demonstrate this point, the complainant highlighted\nthat the National Agency for Medicines and Health Products Safety (ANSM) in\nFrance had recommended on 7 January, three days prior to publication, an\nextension between doses of the BioNTech and Pfizer vaccine beyond three weeks,\nwith the World Health Organisation (WHO) recommending a similar policy on 8\nJanuary.\n5. Furthermore, the complainant said the article was\nmisleading as it failed to mention the large body of expert opinion which\nsupported the approach adopted by the UK Government and the delay between the\nadministration of doses of Covid-19 vaccines. In addition, he expressed concern\nthat the article was misleading to refer to the three scientists quoted as\n“experts” within this particular field.\n6. The newspaper did not accept it had breached the Code. It\nsaid that the disputed statement that “no other country has followed suit”\nshould not be viewed in isolation but rather in the context of the whole\narticle. Whilst it accepted that other countries had extended the interval\nbeyond three weeks, the UK was the only country, at the time of publication, to\nextend this gap to 12 weeks. This was double the six-week interval introduced\nby other countries and the emergency recommendation put forward by the WHO. As\nsuch, the newspaper said it was not inaccurate or misleading to report that  “no other country [had] followed suit” of the\nUK’s policy. The newspaper maintained that this position was made sufficiently\nclear within the article and readers would not be misled on this point. In any\nevent, it added that France’s decision to extend the interval between doses\nfrom three to six weeks – in line with the recommendations of the WHO – was not\nformally implemented until several weeks after the article was published, with\na recommendation put forward by the ANSM on 7 January not indicative of the\ncountry’s official vaccination policy.\n7. The newspaper made clear that it was not obliged to cite\nevery point of view on a particular issue, acknowledging that this was a short\nnews report focused upon a single matter and thereby naturally limited in its\nscope. Notwithstanding this, it noted that the article made clear the\njustification put forward by the Government for delaying a second dose and\nreferred to a number of articles it had printed before and after this article\nwhich “strongly” gave the opposite views of those quoted within the article\nunder complaint. In addition, it noted that the assertion the consequences of\nthe UK’s vaccination strategy could be “catastrophic” was clearly the view of a\nparticular academic and presented as such. It stated that the article reported\nthe concerns of some experts on a matter of great public interest. Whilst it\nsaid the term “expert” was open to interpretation, it noted that each of the\nindividuals quoted were currently working, or had previously worked, in\nrelevant fields including epidemiology and immunology.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n8. The Committee acknowledged the complainant’s concern\nthat, reading the disputed statement in isolation, readers might understand it\nto mean that the UK was the only country that had extended the interval between\ndoses of the Covid-19 vaccines beyond three weeks. However, the Committee had\nregard for the article as a whole and was satisfied that it was sufficiently\nclear that the action referred to in the phrase “no other country  has followed suit” was  the UK’s specific policy in delaying second\ndoses of vaccines, rather than a general policy in delaying second doses. The\nphrase amounted to a statement that no other country had taken the same course\nof action as the UK. Given the article had clearly set out the UK’s policy –\nthat the second dose of the vaccine would be delayed by 12 weeks – the Committee\ndid not agree the article would mislead readers to understand that no other\ncountry had adopted a policy of delaying the second dose beyond three weeks,\nbut rather they would understand that no other country had adopted a policy of\ndelaying the second dose by 12 weeks. There was no breach of Clause 1.\n9. The Committee noted that the selection of material was a\nmatter of editorial discretion, as long as the Code was not otherwise breached.\nIn this instance, there was no suggestion within the article that the views\nreported represented some form of scientific consensus – but rather that these\nscientists, who were identified in the article, held specific points of view.\nIn reporting these concerns, the newspaper was not obliged to also report views\nthat may have contradicted the position(s) presented. The absence of such views\ndid not raise a breach of the Code, where the claims made were clearly\npresented and attributed as such, a basis was provided for them, and where it\nwas not in dispute that the newspaper had accurately reported these views.\nThere was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n10. Finally, the Committee considered whether the article\nwas misleading to refer to the three scientists quoted as “experts” within this\nparticular field. The Committee noted that the term “expert” was, to a certain\ndegree, subjective. In such circumstances, and where the newspaper was able to\nprovide evidence to demonstrate the academic credentials of the individuals in\nrelevant fields during IPSOs investigation, the Committee was satisfied that\nthis particular characterisation was not significantly misleading in this\ncontext. There was no breach of Clause 1 in regard to this.\nConclusions\n11. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n12. N/A\n \nDate complaint received: 10/01/2021\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 02/06/2021\n \nIndependent Complaints Reviewer\nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint.  The Independent Complaints Reviewer decided\nthat the process was not flawed and did not uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
