It said that he “allegedly chased his\n67-year-old victim…in a car following a pub argument”. The article quoted the\nalleged victim, who said that the complainant “’was like a wild animal’”, and\nfrom another un-named source who said that the complainant had “’apparently’”\nattacked the victim and “’bit him three times’”. The source said that the\nalleged victim “’had wounds on his thumb, hand and near his eye’” and “’was\ntaken to hospital’”; his partner was reported as having said that he had been\n“’badly beaten’”. The article said that the complainant had said “’No comment,\nmate’” in response to a request for comment, and that the police had said that\n“a 53-year-old man was held on suspicion of assault and freed as inquiries\ncontinue”. An ambulance spokesman was quoted as stating that three patients had\nbeen taken to hospital in relation to the incident. 3.   \nThis\narticle appeared online in substantially the same format under the headline\n“Emmerdale’s Mark Jordon arrested for ‘biting OAP’ in pub row”, on 14 July. 4.   \nThe\nSeptember article reported on the alleged victim’s account of the incident\nreported in the July article. The sub-headlines read “Mark bit me 3 times in\npub” and “He attacked like wild animal”. The article, which named the alleged\nvictim, said that the man “claims he was bitten three times by Emmerdale star\n[the complainant]” – on the face, thumb and hand. It included the alleged victim’s\naccount of the incident, including his claim that the complainant “’was like a\nwild animal’”. The alleged victim was reported as stating that he had shouted\n“’Emmerdale’” in the pub, and made a joke about the complainant’s daughter\nkissing her boyfriend; he said a “’scuffle’” had ensued, and the complainant\nhad come after him in a taxi. The alleged victim said that the complainant\n“’threw a £5 at the driver and then stood in the street shouting’”; he added\nthat the complainant “’pushed my girlfriend and then I kicked him. But he\ndidn’t flinch and went for me instead’”. The article said that the complainant\ndeclined to comment when approached at the time. The article included a\nphotograph of the alleged victim showing the injuries to his face and hand. 5.   \nThis\narticle appeared online in substantially the same format under the headline\n“OAP says he was BITTEN three times including once in the face by Emmerdale’s\nMark Jordan [sic] after pub row turns vicious”, published on 15 September. This\nversion of the article included two additional photographs of the man’s\ninjuries. 6.   \nThe\nOctober article reported that the complainant had been charged with GBH and\nassault after allegedly biting an OAP. It repeated several of the alleged\nvictim’s claims from the September article, and included a statement from the\npolice confirming that the complainant had been charged with GBH and common\nassault. It included the same photograph as the September article. The article\ngave the name and age of the complainant’s daughter, in relation to the alleged\nvictim’s account of the joke he said he had made about her. 7.   \nThis\narticle appeared in substantially the same format online under the headline\n“Mark Jordon charged with GBH for ‘BITING an OAP’ during pub row”. 8.   \nThe\ncomplainant said that the articles were inaccurate in breach of Clause 1\n(Accuracy), because they had reported on unproven allegations prior to any\ncourt appearance, and had relied on the account of the alleged victim in doing\nso; this had led to a one-sided account of the incident being presented. He\nsaid it was for the court to decide the truth of the matter, and that the\ninjuries the alleged victim sustained were caused by the complainant’s attempts\nto defend himself from him. 9.   \nThe\ncomplainant also said that it was inaccurate for the July article to state that\nhe had followed the alleged victim in a car down a country lane, and for the\nSeptember article to state that he was bitten in a pub: in fact, the incident\nhad occurred on a main road, and he had been in a taxi. He said it was\ninaccurate for the July article to quote an ambulance source as having stated\nthat three patients were taken to hospital: he said that no-one had been taken\nby ambulance to hospital. 10. The complainant said that it was\ninaccurate for the September article to state that he had attacked the alleged\nvictim “like a wild animal”, and that he had been “badly beaten”. He said it\nwas inaccurate for the September article to state that he had been released on\nbail: in fact, he had been released pending a CPS review of the case. The\ncomplainant also disputed the alleged victim’s account of the incident,\npresented in the September and October articles: he said that the alleged\nvictim had taken photographs of his daughter and threatened to post them\nonline, and had insulted her and his partner. He also said that the alleged\nvictim could not have known how he behaved towards the taxi driver, when he was\nnot present, and said that it was incorrect for the alleged victim to state\nthat the complainant had pushed his girlfriend. 11. The complainant also said that\nthe October article had breached Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause 9 (Reporting of\ncrime) because it had named his daughter. He also said that reporting on the\nmatter while it was ongoing was an intrusion into his privacy. 12. The complainant also said that\nthe publication had breached Clause 15 (Witness payments in criminal trials),\nbecause he had heard that the alleged victim had received payment for his story\nand for the photographs of him included in the September and October articles. 13. The publication denied any breach\nof Clause 1 (Accuracy). It said that the July article had been based on the\naccount of the alleged victim, and on the comments made by the police and\nambulance services. It said that the articles had made clear that, at the time\nof publication, the details of the incident were unproven allegations; the\nalleged victim’s account had not been reported as fact. The publication said\nthat the complainant had been given the opportunity to comment on the story, by\nphone, at his home and by email, but had declined to do so. The publication\nsaid that the reference to the complainant being released on bail was not\nmisleading, where the coverage made clear that the case was ongoing, and where\nthe complainant had subsequently appeared in court charged with wounding and\ncommon assault. It said that the description of the complainant as acting like\na “wild animal” was plainly presented as the alleged victim’s characterisation. 14. The publication denied any breach\nof Clause 2 (Privacy) or Clause 9 (Reporting of crime). It said that the\narticle had reported on an alleged criminal offence taking place in a public\nplace, and that therefore the complainant had no reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. It said that the complainant’s daughter was clearly relevant to the\nstory, in that it was alleged that the incident had arisen following the\nalleged victim having made a joke about her behaviour in the pub. 15. The publication denied any breach\nof Clause 15 (Witness payments in criminal trials).  It said that no payment had been made to the\nalleged victim in exchange for any information; rather, a payment had been made\nfor the copyright of the images published in the September and October\narticles. These articles did not contain any additional substantive information\nbeyond that included in the July article, for which no payment had been made.\nThe publication said that it would not have made commercial sense for it to\nhave paid for information in September which it had already obtained for free\nin July; this showed that the payment was only for the copyright of the images,\nwhich was paid to the alleged victim on account of him having taken the\nphotographs. The publication said that the amount the man was paid for the\nphotographs had not been agreed in advance of their exchange. It said that\nthere was a public interest in publications being able to pay individuals for\nthe copyright of images, even where they were potential witnesses; this was\ndistinct from making a payment for information. \nRelevant\nCode Provisions 16. Clause 1\n(Accuracy) i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or\ndistorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be\ncorrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an\napology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as\nrequired by the regulator. iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be\ngiven, when reasonably called for. iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish\nclearly between comment, conjecture and fact. Clause 2\n(Privacy)* i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her\nprivate and family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions\ninto any individual's private life without consent. In considering an\nindividual's reasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information and the extent to which the\nmaterial complained about is already in the public domain or will become so. Clause 6\n(Children)* i) All pupils should be free to complete their time\nat school without unnecessary intrusion. ii) They must not be approached or photographed at\nschool without permission of the school authorities. iii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or\nphotographed on issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a\ncustodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents. iv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material\ninvolving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their\nchildren or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest. v) Editors must not use the fame, notoriety or\nposition of a parent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details\nof a child's private life. \nClause 9 (Reporting of Crime)* i) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused\nof crime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they\nare genuinely relevant to the story.ii) Particular regard should be paid to the potentially\nvulnerable position of children under the age of 18 who witness, or are victims\nof, crime. This should not restrict the right to report legal proceedings.Clause 15 (Witness payments in criminal trials) i) No payment or offer of payment to a witness – or any\nperson who may reasonably be expected to be called as a witness – should be\nmade in any case once proceedings are active as defined by the Contempt of\nCourt Act 1981. This prohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed\nunconditionally by police without charge or bail or the proceedings are\notherwise discontinued; or has entered a guilty plea to the court; or, in the\nevent of a not guilty plea, the court has announced its verdict. \n*ii) Where proceedings are not yet active but are likely\nand foreseeable, editors must not make or offer payment to any person who may\nreasonably be expected to be called as a witness, unless the information\nconcerned ought demonstrably to be published in the public interest and there\nis an over-riding need to   make or\npromise payment for this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken\nto ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses give. In\nno circumstances should such payment be conditional on the outcome of a trial. \nFindings of the Committee 17. The\narticles had presented a series of allegations made by the alleged victim. Care\nhad been taken to present these claims appropriately: they were not adopted as\nfact by the publication, and were set out as allegations attributed to the\nalleged victim, or presented in quotation marks to indicate that they were not\nestablished fact. The publication had also taken steps to verify these claims,\nby contacting the police and ambulance services, whose accounts had been\nincluded in the article. The complainant was not in a position to dispute that\nindividuals had been taken to hospital by ambulance, as the article\nreported.  The publication had also taken\nseveral steps to contact the complainant to seek his response to the claims\nmade by the alleged victim, but he had declined to comment. In these\ncircumstances, there was no failure to take care over the presentation of the\nclaims attributed to the alleged victim in the articles. 18. It was\naccepted that the incident had taken place close to a pub, following an altercation\nthat had occurred in that pub. In those circumstances, it was not significantly\nmisleading for the September article to report in its sub-headline that the\nalleged victim had said that he had been bitten in the pub. The article text\nmade clear that the main altercation had taken place outside the pub, and the\nprecise location of the incident was not material to the report of the matter;\nthere was no significantly misleading impression given that required correction\nunder Clause 1. It was also not in dispute that the complainant had followed\nthe alleged victim in a taxi onto a different road. The July article’s claims\nthat the complainant had followed the man in “a car” onto a “country lane” were\nclearly presented as allegations, and did not give rise to any significantly\nmisleading impression of his actions that would require correction under Clause\n1. There was no breach of Clause 1 on these points. 19. The July\nand September articles’ claims that the complainant had behaved like a “wild\nanimal” were clearly attributed to the alleged victim, and the publication was\nentitled to include his account. Similarly, where the complainant was not in a\nposition to dispute that the man had required hospital treatment, it was not\nmisleading for the July article to report the man’s partner’s claim that he had\nbeen “’badly beaten’”, and this had been clearly attributed to her. There was\nno breach of Clause 1 on these points. In relation to whether the complainant\nhad “thrown” £5 at the taxi driver, as the September article reported, the\ncomplainant did not explain in what way this statement was inaccurate, and the\nCommittee was therefore unable to find that this represented a breach of Clause\n1. In any event, in the context of the article, this claim was not significant\nsuch that any inaccuracy would require correction. 20. The\nSeptember article had stated that the complainant had been released “on bail”.\nThe Committee noted that the complainant was not formally on police bail at\nthis time. However, it was not in dispute that the case was ongoing, and that\nthe CPS was reviewing the matter in relation to the complainant’s involvement,\nat the time the article was published; it was not the case that the complainant\nhad been cleared of any charges at that time. In these circumstances, reporting\nthat he had been released “on bail” did not give rise to any misleading\nimpression of the status of the case. There was no failure to take care over\nthe accuracy of this claim, and no misleading impression was created that\nrequired correction under the terms of Clause 1. 21. The\ncomplainant’s daughter was genuinely relevant to the October article’s report\nof the crime. The alleged victim had stated that the altercation had arisen\nfrom a “joke” he had made about the complainant’s daughter. There was therefore\nno breach of Clause 9 (Reporting of crime). Similarly, the article had reported\non events which had occurred in public locations - a pub, and a public road -\nand which were the subject of allegations of criminality; the complainant and his\ndaughter did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in such\ncircumstances. The alleged victim was also entitled to exercise his right to\nfreedom of expression in relation to the incident. In all these circumstances,\nthere was no breach of Clause 2 (Privacy) in relation to the publication of the\ndetails of the incident. 22. The\nterms of Clause 15 (Witness payments in criminal trials) are designed to\nprevent publications from making payments to individuals who are likely to be\ncalled as witnesses in any upcoming trial; this is to reduce the likelihood\nthat individuals provide information to publications for monetary gain which\nmight have a damaging effect on the administration of justice in the event of\nany future legal proceedings. 23. In this\ninstance, the publication had obtained an initial account of the incident from\nthe alleged victim prior to the publication of the July article, and before any\npayment was made. It had then obtained further information for the September\narticle, which did not materially add to the information which had already been\nreported in the July article – for which the alleged victim had not received\nany payment. The publication had understood that the alleged victim had taken\nthe published photographs himself and had, therefore, made a payment to him as\nthe copyright owner. A payment for copyright is distinct from a payment for\ninformation in that a licence from the copyright owner of a photograph is\nrequired to allow publication for which a payment is customarily made. Where no\npayment had been made for the information contained in the article, there was\nno breach of Clause 15. \nConclusions 28. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial\naction required 29.
