Chris\nFriel complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that thejc.com\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Lie that won’t die: Israel practises ‘apartheid’”, published on 29\nApril 2021.\n2. The\narticle was an opinion piece, written by an academic in the field of political\nscience. It was responding to the then-recent publication of a Human Rights\nWatch (HRW) report ‘A Threshold Crossed: Israeli Authorities and the Crime of\nApartheid and Persecution’. The article stated that Israeli “counter-terror\nmeasures” were “condemned” by the report’s authors on the basis that “the\nauthors claimed (without foundation)” that the measures “were used ’to advance\ndemographic objectives’ without ‘legitimate security justifications.’”  It went on to say that ”[t]he accusations\nwere facilitated by the complete absence of any reference to the thousands of\nvictims of Palestinian terror — as if Israeli Jews were not entitled to human\nrights or security”. The article was accompanied by a photograph of a man,\nholding up a sign with the word ‘apartheid’ mis-spelt.\n3. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 as,\ncontrary to the article’s position that the HRW report authors had advanced\nclaims “without foundation” regarding the Israeli’s authorities use of\ncounter-terror measures “’to advance demographic measures’ without ‘legitimate\nsecurity concerns’”, he considered that there was in fact foundation within the\nreport for the authors’ claims. The complainant noted that the report quoted a\n2005 statement by Ariel Sharon, a previous prime-minister of Israel, in which\nhe had said that “[t]here’s no need to hide behind security arguments. There’s\na need for the existence of a Jewish state.” \nHe went on to note further refences within the report to demographic\nconsiderations on the part of the Israeli government, which he said\ndemonstrated that the claims had not been made “without foundation”; these\nincluded the confiscation of farming land from Palestinians resident in Israel,\nthe use of checkpoints, and the allocation of state land.\n4. The\ncomplainant said that the inclusion of the photograph, showing a man holding up\na sign with the word ‘apartheid’ mis-spelt, also rendered the article\ninaccurate in breach of Clause 1, as it implied that Palestinian people could\nnot spell the term.\n5. The\npublication denied any breach of the Code. It said that the article was an\nopinion piece, based on a prominent academic’s view of the HRW report, which\nthe publication was entitled to publish under the terms of Clause 1 (iv),\nprovided the academic’s opinion was distinguished from fact – which the\npublication said it was. It said that the academic’s opinion was that the\nclaims advanced by the report’s authors regarding the “legitimate security\nconcerns” were without merit, and therefore were advanced “without foundation”,\nwhere the academic contended that: there were “glaring methodological errors”\nin the report; politicians were quoted selectively and without proper context\nin the report; and none of the report’s authors were security experts who would\nbe in a position to examine whether the Israeli government did indeed have\n“legitimate security justifications” for its “counter terror measures”.\n6. The\npublication also addressed the alleged inaccuracy regarding the photograph,\nstating that it was chosen solely to illustrate the article and the complainant\ndid not consider the photograph was doctored. It, therefore, did not accept\nthat the image rendered the article inaccurate, misleading, or distorted in\nbreach of Clause 1.\n7. The\ncomplainant said that, while he could accept that perhaps the article had\nintended to state that there was “no good foundation” to the author’s claims,\nthis was not the same as saying that there was “no foundation”; therefore, the\narticle was – in the complainant’s view – inaccurate in breach of Clause 1.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n8. The\nEditors’ Code makes clear that the press is entitled to campaign, be partisan,\nand express an opinion. However, there remains an obligation under the Clause 1\nto take care over the accuracy of any claims of fact made within a comment\npiece and to distinguish between comment, conjecture and fact. A question for\nthe Committee was, therefore, whether the statement that “the [report] authors\nclaimed (without foundation) that counter-terror measures ‘were used ’to\nadvance demographic objectives’ without ‘legitimate security justifications’”\nwas presented as comment or fact.\n9. The\nCommittee was mindful of the context of the article. It appeared in the Comment\nsection of the publication’s website, and was written in a polemical and\nopinionated style. It was also clearly attributed to the academic, and the\narticle was accompanied by his brief biography. It was therefore clear that the\narticle itself was a comment piece, setting out the reaction of the academic to\nthe HRW report, rather than a news piece on the content of the report.\n10. The\nalleged inaccuracy referred to claims made “without foundation”. The Committee\nconsidered that, in the context of a polemical comment piece, this phrase\nexpressed the writer’s opinion about the adequacy of the evidence cited in the\nreport to support its conclusions, rather than making a factual claim about the\ncontents of the report. While the complainant considered that the report had\nprovided sufficient evidence to support the claim that counter terror measures\nwere being used without legitimate security justifications, the commentator\nevidently rejected this. Furthermore, the disputed assertion was followed by\nadditional criticism by the writer elaborating on the grounds for his view.\nGiven the nature of the claim and the context in which it appeared, the\nCommittee was satisfied that the disputed claim was identified as comment and\nclearly distinguished from fact.  There\nwas no failure to take care over the accuracy of the claim, and no breach of\nClause 1 on this point.\n11. The\nphotograph which accompanied the article was clearly intended for illustrative\npurposes only; the complainant had not suggested that the photograph was\ndigitally altered, and neither the article nor the photograph caption made any\nbroader claims about the extent to which it was representative of the\nPalestinian people. There was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusions\n12. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n13. N/A\n \nDate\ncomplaint received: 30/04/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 01/09/2021\n \nIndependent\nComplaints Reviewer\nThe\ncomplainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process\nfollowed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent Complaints\nReviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold the request\nfor review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
