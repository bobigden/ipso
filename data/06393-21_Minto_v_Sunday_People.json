Carol\nMinto complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Sunday\nPeople breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “I spoke out about evil doc's abuse and it gave 100 others a\nvoice”, published on 6th June 2021.\n2. The\narticle reported on an upcoming book written by the complainant in which she\ndetailed the abuse she had experienced as a child. It reported that, as a\nchild, she had been sexually assaulted by her brother for years before she\nbegan to run away from home. The article explained that the complainant told\nher mother and a social worker what had been happening, but that, instead of\nhelping her, her mother signed her into a psychiatric hospital. The article\nreported that, whilst the complainant was in the hospital, she was drugged and\nabused by a doctor. The article stated that the doctor “drugged her and\nre-enacted the same abuse she had suffered at the hands of her father”. It\nexplained that when the complainant returned home, “her parents wanted to\n‘ignore the past’”.\n3. The\narticle also appeared online under the headline, “’I spoke out about evil\ndoctor’s abuse and it helped 100 others find their voice’”.\n4. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 because\nit claimed that she had been abused by her father. She stated this was never\nthe case, as the only family member by whom she had been abused was her\nbrother. The complainant said that this inaccuracy had led her to receive messages\nfrom others expressing their shock that she would label her father a child\nabuser and that her wider family had become hostile towards her as a result.\n5. The\npublication said it acknowledged that there had been an error and said it was\n“extremely regretful for the mistake”. It published the following correction\nand apology on 13th June 2021 on page 6:\n“A story\nin last week’s Sunday People entitled ‘I spoke out about evil doc’s abuse and\nit gave 100 other victims a voice’ on pages 24 and 25 contained an error. It\nstated at one point that Carol Minto had been abused by her father when it\nshould have stated “by her brother’”. We apologise for this error and are happy\nto set the record straight.”\n6. It\nstated that this was sufficient to correct the inaccuracy in line with the\nrequirements of Clause 1 (ii) as it was published in the following edition of\nthe newspaper and was published with due prominence as it appeared in the\nestablished Corrections and Clarifications column on Page 6, whereas the\noriginal article was published on pages 24 and 25.\n7. The\npublication explained that the online article had been corrected three days\nafter it had been published as a result after it was alerted to the error by\nthe journalist who wrote the book about the complainant. It said that, as the\nerror had been corrected quickly, and, given the sensitivity of the issue, no\nfootnote or standalone correction had been published online, which would have\nmeant ongoing republication of the inaccuracy. During IPSO’s investigation, the\npublication added a correction to the top of the article that stated:\n“Correction:\nA previous version of this article stated that Dr Kenneth Miulner had\nre-enacted the same abuse that Carol Minto had suffered at the hands of her\nfather. In fact, it was Carol Minto’s brother that had abused her, and not her\nfather. We are happy to clarify this and apologise for the error.”\n8. The\ncomplainant did not accept this as a resolution to her complaint.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator.\niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n9. There\nwas no dispute that, having initially correctly reported that the complainant\nhad suffered abuse by her brother as a young girl, part way through, the\narticle inaccurately referred to “abuse [the complainant] had suffered at the\nhands of her father”. This error showed a clear failure on the part of the\npublication to take sufficient care not to publish inaccurate information and,\ntherefore, the Committee established a breach of Clause 1 (i) of the Code.\n10.\nGiven the gravity of the subject matter and traumatic experiences of the\ncomplainant, this misidentification of the complainant’s abuser was significant\nand therefore required correction, promptly and with due prominence, in\naccordance with the terms of Clause 1 (ii) of the Code. It was also appropriate\nfor the publication to apologise, given that the inaccuracy related to a highly\npersonal, sensitive subject.\n11. The\nCommittee considered the corrective action undertaken by the publication and\nassessed whether it fulfilled the obligations of Clause 1 (ii). Regarding the\nprint version of the article, the publication had published a correction in the\nnext edition of the newspaper – published the following week – which identified\nthe inaccuracy, set out the correct position and apologised for the error. It\nhad been published in the newspaper’s established corrections column, on page\n6, which was significantly further forward in the newspaper to the page on\nwhich the article under complaint appeared. While the inaccuracy was clearly\nhighly significant and had caused the complainant significant distress, the\nCommittee concluded on balance that the corrective action taken by the\npublication was sufficient to meet the requirements of Clause 1 (ii) of the Code.\n12. The\nonline article had been updated three days after publication. The publication\nsaid it had considered the sensitivity of the issue at hand and did not want to\nrepeat the error. Once the publication was made aware that the online article\nformed part of the complainant’s complaint, it added the correction to the top\nof the article, underneath the headline. The Committee noted that the error had\nbeen corrected as soon as the publication had been made aware of it by the\njournalist. The error was significant and sensitive, and the publication had\npromptly corrected it in print. On balance, the Committee considered that there\nwas justification for not publishing a separate correction online in addition\nto the amendment, in the absence of a complaint from the complainant. A\ncorrection was added to the article as soon as the publication became aware it\nformed part of the complaint and appeared beneath the headline of the article.\nIn the circumstances, this was sufficiently prompt and prominent and there was,\ntherefore, no further breach of Clause 1 of the Code in relation to the\ncorrection.\nConclusions\n13. The\ncomplaint was upheld under Clause 1.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n14. The\npublished correction and apology put the correct position on record and was\noffered and published promptly and with due prominence. No further action was\nrequired.\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 17/06/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 18/06/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
