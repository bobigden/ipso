Lauren Goodger complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the dailystar.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Lauren Goodger says she\nwon't be having Covid vaccine as she likens virus to a 'cold'”, published on 5\nJanuary 2021.\n2. The article reported on an Instagram livestream held by a\nreality TV star. The article reported that during the Instagram video the star\nhad shared concerns regarding Covid-19 and the vaccine. The article alleged\nthat the star had “declared she ‘doesn't agree with masks’ and won't be taking\nthe vaccine if it was offered to her” and that she was “’terrified’ of the\nvaccine” and had said “I am more scared of the vaccine than I am of the virus.\nI will start imagining that I am dying”. The article also reported that the\nstar had compared Covid-19 to a “cold”, during the video. It said that the star\nhad gone on a “rant” regarding the vaccine, stating: “\"I just feel that it\nhasn't been around long enough and we don't know enough about it […] I don't\nwant to inject myself with something I don't know the longterm effects. I have\nheard all the different things that are in it and I think I have had Covid\nalready and I have coped with it.\" The article also reported she had said\nthe following regarding masks: \"I don't believe in masks - I am not going\nto get into the subject. When I have a mask on and I walk I can't wear one as I\nget into a panic. I do have an exempt card but I don't use it as it is a bit\nmuggy”.\n3. The complainant was the reality TV star named in the\narticle. She said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 and\nthat she had not said any of the quotes included. She accepted that she had\ndone an Instagram livestream, but that the topics discussed were fake tan, Mr\nPotato head, that lockdown was boring but essential, and a discussion about how\nshe met someone. She said she did not talk about a fear of the vaccine or her\nuse of masks, and noted that she had been photographed wearing a mask on\nseveral occasions.\n4. The publication did not accept a breach of the Code. It\nsaid that a reporter had watched the livestream and took contemporaneous notes.\nThe Instagram live stream had not been saved locally, nor to IGTV and therefore\ncould not be provided to the Committee for consideration. Instead it provided\nIPSO with a transcript of these notes which had been taken on computer,\nhowever, this document did not include any of the quotes in the article. The\npublication said that the quotes had been written up contemporaneously, however\nthe reporter had used the cut and paste function to put them into the article,\nmeaning that the notes document did not have the contested quotes in it. The\npublication supplied two screenshots of viewer comments from the livestream\nwhich stated: “why are you scared about the vaccine lauren” and “covid vaccine\nmight be dangerous than having covid how do they now it's not...”. The\npublication also stated that a breakfast television programme had reiterated\nwhat the publication had said was part of the livestream, and noted that the\ncomplainant had retweeted someone saying that they would not be getting the\nvaccine. The publication maintained that the livestream had discussed the\nCovid-19 vaccine and the wearing of masks and said that the reactions of fans\nand the breakfast TV reporting supported its position. Regardless, during the\ncomplaints process, the publication offered to publish the following as a\nfootnote to the article:\nSince this article was published, Lauren Goodger has advised\nthat she no longer holds the views and comments that she stated in her\nInstagram Live.\n5. The complainant noted that the publication had not\nprovided any record of the contested quotes, and also stated that she did not\nbelieve that the transcript of notes provided accurately reflected what was\nsaid in the livestream, in addition to the quotes in the article under\ncomplaint. It also noted that the television show may have been discussing the\nquotes from the article under complaint, rather than the Instagram livestream\nitself. The complainant provided an email from the television show which stated\nthat these quotes were taken from an online article.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n6. There was a disagreement between the complainant and the\npublication as to whether the complainant had said the quotes which had been\nattributed to her in the article. As the livestream could not be provided by\neither party, the Committee was not in a position to definitively make a\nfinding as to the content of this video. However, under the Code, publications\nare obliged to demonstrate that they have taken care not to publish inaccurate\ninformation.\n7. The publication had said it had taken contemporaneous\nnotes of the complainant’s livestream, but that the relevant sections relating\nto the quotes published within the article had been deleted when they were\npasted into the article, and therefore it did not have any notes of the quotes\nunder dispute. It had also stated that other sources had commented on the\ncomplainant’s Instagram livestream, but was not able to demonstrate that these\ncomments came from viewing the livestream, rather than seeing the article. The\npublication had also provided screenshots from the livestream. Whilst these\ncomments referred to the vaccine, they did not corroborate all of the quotes\nincluded in the article that were under complaint. The Committee noted that\nproper record keeping is a part of abiding by the Editors’ Code. In this\ninstance, the publication had stated as fact that the complainant had said the\nquotes in the article; on balance the Committee decided that the absence of\ncontemporaneous notes, or other evidence that demonstrated this to be the case,\nresulted in a breach of Clause 1(i).  The\nallegations were significant as they formed the basis of the article, and\nrelated to significant claims regarding Covid-19 and public health. Where the\npublication had failed to demonstrate that it had taken care over the accuracy\nof the statements, a correction was required in order to satisfy Clause 1(ii).\nThe publication had offered to publish a statement, but this did not constitute\na correction or recognise that the publication did not have the notes to\nsupport its claims, and there was a further breach of Clause 1(ii).\nConclusions\n8. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1.\nRemedial Action Required\n9. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1, the Committee\nconsidered what remedial action should be required. In circumstances where the\nCommittee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the\npublication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of\nwhich is determined by IPSO.\n10. The Committee noted the complexities of this complaint,\nand acknowledged that there was no way to know the definitive position as to\nwhat was said in the livestream. However, it considered that the publication\nhad not been able to demonstrate that it had taken sufficient care when\nreporting what the complainant had said as required under Clause 1. In all the\ncircumstances, the Committee considered that the appropriate remedy was the\npublication of a correction to put the correct position on record.\n11. The Committee then considered the placement of this\ncorrection. This correction should be added to the article and appear as a\nstandalone correction in the online corrections and clarifications column. This\nwording should only include information required to correct the inaccuracy:\nthat the publication had not taken care and could not demonstrate that the\ncomplainant had said the quotes published. The wording should also be agreed\nwith IPSO in advance and should make clear that it has been published following\nan upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation. If the\npublication intends to continue to publish the online article without\namendment, the correction on the article should be published beneath the\nheadline. If the article is amended, the correction should be published as a\nfootnote which explains the amendments that have been made.\n \nDate complaint received: 06/01/2021\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 27/05/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
