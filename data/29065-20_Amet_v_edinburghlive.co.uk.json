In circumstances where the Committee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the publication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of which is determined by IPSO. 47. The Committee considered that the publication did not take the necessary care when reporting that the complainant had stated that chicken nuggets could “alleviate symptoms” of autism. The Committee considered that the appropriate remedy was the publication of a correction to put the correct position on record. A correction was considered to be sufficient, as the claim was not the central point of the article, which reported on the full recommendations provided by the complainant in the video consultation, and the publication had promptly offered a correction to address the claims that had been found to be inaccurate, notwithstanding the Committee’s finding that the wording offered was not sufficient to address the inaccuracies fully. 48. The Committee then considered the placement of the correction. The correction should be added to the article. The wording of the correction should only include information required to identify the inaccuracies and provide the correct position: that the complainant had referenced chicken nuggets based on the specific case study presented and as part of a wider meal plan. The wording should also be agreed with IPSO in advance and should make clear that it has been published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation. If the publication intends to continue to publish the online article without amendment, the correction should be published beneath the headline. If the article is amended, the correction should be published as a footnote which explains the amendments that have been made.     Date complaint received: 02/11/2020",
    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision\nof the Complaints Committee – 29065-20 Amet v edinburghlive.co.uk\nSummary\nof Complaint\n1. Lorene\nAmet complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nedinburghlive.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause\n10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Expensive Edinburgh doctor comes under fire after autism\nclaims”, published on 2 November 2021.\n2. The\narticle reported on an investigation into an autism specialist. The article\nreported how an investigator, “a mum who has two autistic children, went\nundercover to pose as worried mum Petra to discuss fictional Raye, seven” to\nhave a video consultation with the specialist. It said that the “paper\ninvestigated the clinic after receiving a number of complaints from concerned\nparents about the work of Amet’s clinic […] which claims to have improved the\ndevelopment of 80 per cent of its patients.” The article contained a still\nimage of the specialist taken from the video consultation.\n3. The article\nclaimed that the specialist had said that the child’s diet could be behind her\n“challenging behavioural issues”, that “organic chicken nuggets could alleviate\nsymptoms”, and that the specialist had sent the investigator “vegan recipes” as\npart of the consultation. It also stated that the specialist had suggested that\nthe MMR vaccine was linked to autism. The article reported that “experts” had\n“slammed” the specialist’s remarks, and contained a quote from a named doctor.\nThe article said that the investigator received an email with the tagline\n“Autism is treatable”. The article said that the specialist had recommended\nvarious tests and anti-inflammatories for the child and that “further\n‘treatment’ would involve working with other doctors in Geneva.”\n4. The\ncomplainant was the specialist referred to in the article. She said that the\narticle had breached Clause 10 of the Editors’ Code, as the video consultation\nhad been recorded and an image had been taken of her without her knowledge with\na clandestine device. She said that the investigator had engaged in subterfuge\nby inventing a child and concealing the fact she was working for a newspaper in\norder to arrange the session. The complainant said that the article was not in\nthe public interest as the allegations against her were false and the article\nwas inaccurate. She also said that the investigator had undisclosed conflicts\nof interest: she worked as an activist for a company whose work focused on\npeople with autism; she had worked with the press previously and had been paid\nfor this work; and she believed the investigator and journalist were biased\nagainst her.\n5. The\ncomplainant also said the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. She\nstated that she had not said that the child’s diet could be behind her\n“challenging behavioural issues”, nor that “organic chicken nuggets” could\nalleviate the symptoms of autism. She said that in fact she had recommended a\nself-restrictive diet overall, and that chicken nuggets were simply an example\nof how a food that the specific case had been said to consume previously could\nbe made with healthy ingredients and less inflammatory food, in line with this\ndiet. She also said that it was a contradiction within the article to state she\nrecommended both “chicken nuggets” and “vegan recipes”, and it was therefore\ninaccurate to describe the recipes as vegan.\n6. The\ncomplainant said it was inaccurate to report that the probe was triggered after\na parent raised concerns about the complainant. The complainant said she was\nnot aware of such concerns, nor did she think such a parent would have\ncontacted the publication.\n7. The\ncomplainant said it was misleading for the article to state that the\ncomplainant’s practice “claims to have improved the development of 80 per cent\nof its patients”, as her website did not state that 80% of families who come to\nher seeking advice improve due to the diet change.\n8. The\ncomplainant also said it was inaccurate to report that she had suggested that\nthe MMR vaccine is linked to autism, as she had never said this, and that she\nhad mentioned other possible factors that may have contributed to the child’s\nautism. She also said that it was the investigator who had repeatedly brought\nup the MMR vaccine and asked her whether there was a link.\n9. The\ncomplainant said it was misleading to report that “experts”, including the\nquoted doctor, had “slammed” the complainant’s remarks. She said that firstly,\nas she disputed that she had made the comments in the article, it was\ninaccurate to report that experts had disagreed with her. She also said that as\nonly one expert was named it was inaccurate to refer to “experts” in the\nplural.\n10. The\narticle claimed that the investigator was sent an email with the tagline “Autism\nis treatable”. The complainant said she did not send an email with this\ntagline. She supplied both the email sent and the questionnaire she intended\nthe investigator to answer, which did not have this tagline. The investigator\nhad also sent the complainant screenshots of the survey she had completed,\nwhich the complainant provided and which did not contain the tagline “Autism is\ntreatable”. She accepted that the third-party website that this questionnaire\ncame from used the tagline “autism is treatable” but noted that she did not\nsend a document with this tagline personally.\n11. The\ncomplainant said it was misleading to report that she had recommended various\ntests and “anti-inflammatories”. She said that, in fact, after the investigator\nasked what testing was available, she made her aware of such tests in response\nto her request. She said she also made clear there were no benefits to testing,\nand that therefore she could not be described as “recommending” tests. The\ncomplainant also said she did not recommend “anti-inflammatories”, but a diet\nthat was anti-inflammatory in nature. She said that as she did not recommend\nsuch consultations or tests, it was inaccurate to report that “further\n‘treatment’ would involve working with other doctors in Geneva.”\n12. The\ncomplainant also said that the article breached Clause 2 (Privacy) as the\narticle included a screenshot of the video consultation showing her face, in\nher home where she worked.\n13. The\npublication did not accept a breach of the Code. It accepted that Clause 10 was\nengaged, but said that there was sufficient public interest to justify the\ninvestigator’s actions. It said that a source made the publication aware of the\ncomplainant's firm and that a further source told it the complainant's firm had\nbeen mentioned to them by concerned parents in the course of their work campaigning\nfor government regulation over unproven autism treatments. The publication then\ncommissioned an investigator it had worked with previously to pursue the story.\nThe publication said that, prior to engaging in the subterfuge, there was a\ndiscussion with the editor as to what information would be collected, the means\nof collecting it, and whether it was in the public interest.\n14. The\npublication stated that no other methods had been used to gain the\ncomplainant’s views; however, the misrepresentation and subterfuge was\nproportionate and had to be used in this case in order to see how the\ncomplainant engaged with a potential client, rather than a newspaper. It said\nthat a video consultation was the usual practice in the complainant’s booking process\nand therefore used this method as it was not aware of a way to receive a\nsimilar result with a lower level of subterfuge or a less intrusive method, or\nno clandestine device.\n15. The\npublication also stated that the investigation was in the public interest on\nthe grounds that it would help protect public health and safety and would\nprotect the public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual\nor organisation. The publication also said that previous investigations had\nfound that the complainant did not disclose that her doctorate was not medical.\nIt also stated that if parents are paying or considering paying for the therapy\non the understanding that this is a legitimate 'medical' treatment, then they\nwere potentially being exploited and the general public needed to be made\naware.\n16. With\nregards to the accuracy of the article, the publication provided a transcript\nof the recording, and shortly afterwards the audio recording of the meeting.\nThe complainant subsequently made amendments to the transcript, which were\naccepted by the publication and said supported the article’s accuracy.\n17. The\npublication noted that the complainant’s website stated: ”In our opinion, 80%\nof individuals respond favourably to a dietary modification. The improvements\nmay include improved bowel habit, general health and well being, appetite and\nweight regulation, and in children with autism, improved behaviours and sleep\npatterns, eye contact, social communication and sensory issues.” The publication\nsaid that it was therefore not misleading to report that the complainant’s\npractice “claims to have improved the development of 80 per cent of its\npatients”.\n18. The\npublication referred to a section of the transcript which stated the following:\nComplainant:\nWe are going to discuss it. Number one is the diet – the diet, we have to\nchange it. It is almost certain that your daughter is in pain and that’s why\nshe wakes up. This is in part because of the diet.\n[...]\nComplainant:\nWell as I said, we remove the food which are pro-inflammatory. These foods\ncontribute to maintaining inflammation. The inflammation could have been\ntriggered by the genetics or the vaccine but it is maintained. She is\ndisplaying issues of health because of a sudden onset of challenging\nbehavioural and self injurious behaviour; she is in pain. Until you change the\ndiet, that pain will not stop. There is no magic pill in autism. Zero. I cannot\ngive you one pill which will take it away.\nThe\npublication therefore said it was not inaccurate to report that the complainant\nhad said that the child’s diet could be behind her “challenging behavioural\nissues”. It added that the article as a whole made clear that the complainant’s\nadvice was change to the child’s diet in general, but stated that the\ncomplainant went into a lot of detail regarding a recipe for organic chicken\nnuggets. It said, where the complainant had said that “number one is diet” and\nthat “this is in part because of the diet”, it was not misleading to report\nthat organic chicken nuggets could alleviate symptoms of autism. Whilst it did\nnot accept a breach of Clause 1, the publication offered to publish the\nfollowing as a footnote to the article:\nWe are\nhappy to make clear Dr Amet's suggestion of removing gluten from home-made\nchicken nuggets is part of her wider diet plan, to help people with autism.\nAlways seek medical advice before starting any new treatment or diet.    \n19. The\npublication said that where many of the recipes supplied by the complainant were\nvegan, it was not inaccurate to report that she had recommended “vegan\nrecipes”.\n20. The\npublication stated that the complainant not being aware of the concerns being\nraised by parents was not a breach of Clause 1. It reiterated that this was an\nimportant factor for the publication’s investigation.\n21. The\npublication stated that the complainant had linked the MMR vaccine to autism.\nIt supplied the following passage from the transcript:\nComplainant:\nYes,…basically, as you know the NHS and the official position is there’s no\nlink between vaccination and it […]\nThere’s\nbeen quite a number of studies which have suggested otherwise and of course,\nquite a lot of the opinion has been suppressed and people have been attacked\nfor questioning the safety of vaccination, especially MMR.\n[…]\nComplainant:\nAs far as I’m concerned I have heard the story you are sharing, over and over -\nI have no doubt there are children who are affected by this. It actually fits\nvery well with what we understand autism for some children to be. The animal\nmodel where you mimic infections when you basically cause a burdening of the\nimmune system and vaccination is a means to cause the system to be overwhelmed.\nThat causes inflammation, this affects brain function. This can link to gut\nissues, this can link to behaviour And unfortunately sometimes these changes\nare essentially irreversible.\nInvestigator:\nIt’s terrible they’ve been getting away from it for so long.\nComplainant:\nYes, it is terrible. I remain - I don’t remain hopeful - but I believe\neventually it will be accepted. I believe it will be. It only needs the right\nperson in the right place -a president whose child has the same issue could\ncompletely change the whole thing and completely stop it. One person alone in\nthe right place a the right time could do that but at the moment all\nscientists, all doctors, who have raised their concern have been attacked.\nBasically you can’t do anything. Even doctors do not do their job because\nnormally when there is an adverse reaction you have to complete a form which is\ncalled a yellow card to flag the adverse reaction to this. But they don’t do\nthis because they say oh no, there is no link - therefore they’re not even\nreporting it, saying autism is starting off at 18 months of age, it’s just a\ncoincidence. But the reality is we have children who have been given the\nvaccination earlier than planned and they’ve developed the signs of autism at\neight months , we equally have children who receive the vaccination much later,\neven age of eight, and they develop sign of autism at that point. And that\ndoesn’t fit with the textbook description of autism and when you develop it.\n22. The\npublication provided the emails that had been sent to experts, and the response\nof the doctor named in the article, which included the quote that was reported.\nIt also stated that two other experts had commented, but had asked to remain\nanonymous.\n23. The\npublication said that the investigator had been sent links to two forms to\ncomplete with questions about her daughter ahead of the meeting. One of the\nquestionnaires that was sent to the investigator was from a website which used\nthe tagline 'Autism is Treatable'. It said it was not significantly inaccurate\nto report that this was a tagline to the email, rather than to a form linked to\nby an email. However, it changed the article to state that it was a tagline to\na questionnaire, rather than an email, but did not offer a correction on this\npoint.\n24. The\npublication did not accept that the complainant had not recommended tests and\n“anti-inflammatories”. It acknowledged that the complainant had initially\nadvised that “before investing in tests I would suggest you would start with\nthe diet” but said that the complainant said that the child should “go on to”\nanti-inflammatory supplements straight away. The complainant also explained\nthat there were multiple tests that could be done at home in order to assess\nthe patient’s health.\n25. The\npublication noted that after the session, the complainant sent a document\ndescribing tests she would “recommend”, which gave information on blood, urine,\nhair and stool tests, the total cost of which was £971.90. The publication also\nnoted that during the interview, the complainant had said she worked with\nmedical doctors who worked in Geneva.\n26. The\npublication did not accept that the use of the image of the complainant in the\narticle breached Clause 2 (Privacy). It said the image simply showed her\nlikeness and included no information over which the complainant had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. The publication also said that the use of\nthe image was justified as it demonstrated that the investigation had taken\nplace. It also said that, in any case, there is a strong public interest in\nrelation to protecting public health and safety and preventing the public from\nbeing misled by some statement or action of that individual.\n27. The\ncomplainant said that the offered correction did not resolve her complaint, as\nshe did not suggest removing gluten from homemade chicken nuggets or a wider\ndiet plan “to help people with autism”, but in order to help the specific case\nof the fictitious child presented to her by the investigator. The complainant\nnoted that she had been told the child ate chicken nuggets every day with no\nfruit or vegetables, and that she had only offered chicken nuggets as tailored\nto this individual.\n28.\nAfter reviewing the email that was sent to the expert by the publication\nseeking a comment for inclusion in the articles, the complainant said it\ncontained multiple inaccuracies. She said that the quote from the expert was,\ntherefore, gained on false pretences, and consequently that it was misleading\nto include the expert’s comments in the article. The email from the publication\nincluded the following information: it said the complainant had “insisted” and\nhad “no doubt” the MMR jab was linked to autism, which the complainant\ndisputed; it said she had recommended “anti-inflammatories” would help the\nchild, which she said gave the appearance that she had recommended drugs, when\nin fact she had recommended supplements with anti-inflammatory properties and\nan anti-inflammatory diet; it stated “given that parents may be taken in by\nclaims and persuaded to spend a lot under the belief their child's autism can\nbe 'treated'”, which the complainant said was inaccurate as she did not\npersuade parents who were free to choose what care they thought would be\nhelpful to them, and she did not “make claims”; it referred to “concern about\nunregulated private clinics in general”, which the complainant said was\nmisleading as she was not required to register with a regulatory body; it did\nnot list all of the recipes sent and only set out a few, describing them as\n“vegan” recipes; it referred to the National Institute of Health Care and\nExcellence discrediting exclusion diets; it said that the complainant had\nblamed the child’s behaviour on her diet which caused her to be “in pain”,\nwhich the complainant said was not accurate and omitted that she had also\nrecommended laboratory testing for the further health causes.\n29. The\npublication did not accept that the email sent to the expert was inaccurate. It\nsaid that the allegations specifically about the complainant were accurate, for\nthe reasons previously cited, and that it was not inaccurate to describe\nnutritional supplements with anti-inflammatory benefits as\n“anti-inflammatories”.  It said that the\nreference to parents being “taken in by claims and persuaded to spend a lot\nunder the belief their child's autism can be 'treated'” and “unregulated\nclinics” was context for the expert and more general rather than being\nspecifically about the complainant. It noted the complainant was not named in\nthe email.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished.

An\nexceptional public interest would need to be demonstrated to over-ride the\nnormally paramount interests of children under 16.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n30. The\nEditors’ Code makes clear that subterfuge and misrepresentation can be\njustified in the public interest, which includes protecting public health and\nsafety. The Committee considered that the investigation into a practitioner who\noffers paid services to help children with autism could be in the public\ninterest, as it was an issue which may concern the protection of public health\nand safety. \n31. The\npublication had commissioned an investigator who had knowledge of the subject,\nwho engaged in misrepresentation and subterfuge in order to create a fake\npersona to pose as a parent of an autistic child and participate in a video\nconsultation. The Committee noted that the complainant had concerns that the\ninvestigator was not impartial ,but made clear that this is not a question that\nfell under the Editors’ Code, or relevant to the requirement under Clause 10.\n32. The\nnewspaper said it had been contacted by a source, and had been put in touch\nwith a further source – both of whom wished to remain anonymous – who raised\nconcerns about the complainant’s firm and treatments which it recommended for\nautism. The publication also noted several parts of the complainant’s website\nwhich provided advice which appeared to contract NHS and the National Institute\nfor Health and Care Excellence guidelines and advice for autism. The newspaper\nhad demonstrated that it considered what information might be obtained from the\nuse of clandestine devices and subterfuge in advance of the investigation, by\ndiscussing several questions with the editor. It had also considered the\nproportionality of the investigation, and concluded it was reasonable for the\njournalist and newspaper to believe that they would be unable to ascertain the\ncomplainant’s usual advice for children with autism, without employing\nsubterfuge and misrepresentation. The Committee noted that a video consultation\nwas the complainant’s usual method of consulting with potential clients, and\nthat the newspaper had simply arranged a consultation by the same method. The\nuse of misrepresentation and subterfuge was justified in the public interest,\nin order to investigate whether the public might be being misled by the actions\nof the complainant. \n33. The\npublication considered that its investigation had demonstrated that the\ncomplainant had recommended exclusion diets against NHS advice and the National\nInstitute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines; that the complainant had\nsuggested that there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism; and that\nthe complainant believed  that studies\nconfirming a link between the two had been supressed. Where these views\nappeared to have been expressed by a health professional, the Committee\nconsidered that the material gathered during the investigation concerned the\nprotection of public health and safety and that its publication was justified\nin the public interest.\n34. The\npublication had appropriately and satisfactorily considered the issues raised\nunder the Code, prior to both its investigation and the publication of the\ninformation. The Committee found that the newspaper had satisfied the\nrequirements of the public interest section of the Code; there was no breach of\nClause 10.\n35. With\nregards to the accuracy of the article, it had stated that the complainant had\nrecommended “organic chicken nuggets” to alleviate the symptoms of autism. For\nthe purposes of the investigation, the publication had created a profile for a\nchild who was said to predominantly eat chicken nuggets. The complainant had\nrecommended a change of diet as part of her assessment and, on the basis of the\nspecific case study that had been presented to her, had explained how a recipe\nfor chicken nuggets could contribute to this. It was a distortion to the extent\nof an inaccuracy to report that the complainant had said organic chicken\nnuggets would alleviate the symptoms of autism, when in fact the complainant\nhad suggested a change of diet in general, and had referred to chicken nuggets\nin response to the particular profile she had been given. The publication had\nnot taken care not to publish inaccurate information on this point, and there\nwas a breach of Clause 1(i). As this claim was one of the factors used to\ndiscredit the complainant, it was a significant inaccuracy requiring correction\nunder Clause 1(ii).\n36. The\npublication offered a correction in its first response to IPSO’s investigation,\nwhich was appropriately prompt in the circumstances. However, the correction\noffered did not address the initial inaccuracy, that chicken nuggets had been\ndiscussed in the context of a specific case study. For this reason, the\ncorrection offered did not satisfy Clause 1(ii) and there was a further breach.\n37.\nWhere many of these were vegan, it was not inaccurate to report that the\ncomplainant had sent “vegan recipes”. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this\npoint.\n38. The\ncomplainant had said she doubted that a parent had raised concerns about her,\nas she was not aware of any parents having concerns and did not believe that\nthey would approach a newspaper about them. Whilst it may have surprised the\ncomplainant that a parent had gone to the newspaper with such concerns, this\nwas based on speculation alone, and the publication had a duty to protect its\nsources under Clause 14. There were no grounds for the Committee to support a\nbreach of Clause 1 on this point.\n39.\nWhere the complainant accepted that her website said “In our opinion, 80% of\nindividuals respond favourably to a dietary modification. The improvements may\ninclude improved bowel habit, general health and well being, appetite and\nweight regulation, and in children with autism, improved behaviours and sleep\npatterns, eye contact, social communication and sensory issues”. It was,\ntherefore not misleading for the article to state that the complainant’s\npractice claimed to have improved the development of 80% per cent of its\npatients by changing their diets. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this\npoint.\n40. The\ncomplainant said she had never suggested that the MMR vaccine was linked to\nautism. However, the complainant accepted the accuracy of the transcript as\ndetailed in paragraph 21 of this decision. The Committee considered that the\ncomplainant’s position as recorded in the agreed transcript of the meeting, as\nquoted above, could accurately be characterised as the complainant suggesting a\nlink between autism and the MMR vaccine. The fact that the investigator had\nasked questions specifically about this did not make reporting the\ncomplainant’s response misleading. There was no breach of Clause 1 on these\npoints.\nThe\ncomplainant accepted that the third-party website she used for questionnaires\ncontained a tagline that stated “autism is treatable”. The link to the third\nparty website was included in the questionnaire sent to the investigator. In\naddition, the Committee noted that whilst the complainant had said that there\nis no “cure” or “treatment” for autism, the name of her company was “Autism\nTreatment Plus”. The publication appeared to acknowledge that the email did not\ncarry the tagline. Nonetheless, where the third-party website linked to in the\nquestionnaire emailed to the investigator used this tagline and the\ncomplainant’s company name referred to “Autism Treatment”, it was not\nsignificantly inaccurate to report that the investigator had been sent a\nquestionnaire with the tagline “autism is treatable”. There was no breach of\nClause 1 on this point.\n42. The\ncomplainant accepted she had said “We will need to assess the full extent of\nyour daughters’ health through laboratory testing” and had then sent a document\nto the investigator after the session which stated “I enclose below some\ninformation below on the tests we recommend”. The complainant had also accepted\nthat the tests would be analysed and prescriptions would be made by doctors in\nGeneva. On this basis, it was not misleading for the article to report that the\ncomplainant had recommended tests, or that treatment would involve working with\n“medics in Geneva”. In addition, the Committee found that it was not\nsignificantly inaccurate to describe supplements with anti-inflammatory\nproperties as “anti-inflammatories”. \nThere was no breach of Clause 1 on these points.\n43. For\nthe reasons given above, the Committee found that the email which had been sent\nby the publication to the expert, which contained the same allegations as\nwithin the article, was not inaccurate. It was, therefore, not inaccurate to\ninclude the quote provided by the expert in the article in response to the\nallegations. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n44. The\nCommittee noted that the image of the complainant used in the article was taken\nwhilst she was in her home, through a video platform, and was taken without the\ncomplainant’s consent or knowledge. However, it noted that it was taken whilst\nthe complainant was acting in her professional capacity, and provided a view of\nher that she openly shared with her clients and potential clients without\nrestrictions, through her video consultations. In such circumstances, the\nCommittee considered that the complainant did not have the same expectation of\nprivacy as someone’s home would normally afford. In addition, the Committee\nnoted that the image had been published to demonstrate that the investigation\nhad taken place.  In all the\ncircumstances, the Committee did not find that the publication of the image\nintruded into the complainant’s private life, and there was no breach of Clause\n2.\nConclusions\n45. The\ncomplaint was partly upheld under Clause 1.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n46.\nHaving upheld a breach of Clause 1, the Committee considered what remedial\naction should be required. In circumstances where the Committee establishes a\nbreach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the publication of a correction\nand/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of which is determined by IPSO.\n47. The\nCommittee considered that the publication did not take the necessary care when\nreporting that the complainant had stated that chicken nuggets could “alleviate\nsymptoms” of autism. The Committee considered that the appropriate remedy was\nthe publication of a correction to put the correct position on record. A\ncorrection was considered to be sufficient, as the claim was not the central\npoint of the article, which reported on the full recommendations provided by\nthe complainant in the video consultation, and the publication had promptly\noffered a correction to address the claims that had been found to be\ninaccurate, notwithstanding the Committee’s finding that the wording offered\nwas not sufficient to address the inaccuracies fully.\n48. The\nCommittee then considered the placement of the correction. The correction\nshould be added to the article. The wording of the correction should only\ninclude information required to identify the inaccuracies and provide the\ncorrect position: that the complainant had referenced chicken nuggets based on\nthe specific case study presented and as part of a wider meal plan. The wording\nshould also be agreed with IPSO in advance and should make clear that it has\nbeen published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation. If the publication intends to continue to publish the online\narticle without amendment, the correction should be published beneath the\nheadline. If the article is amended, the correction should be published as a\nfootnote which explains the amendments that have been made.\n \n \nDate\ncomplaint received: 02/11/2020\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 21/09/2021\n \nIndependent\nComplaints Reviewer\nThe\ncomplainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process\nfollowed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent Complaints\nReviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold the request\nfor review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
