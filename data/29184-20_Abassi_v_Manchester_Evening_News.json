Kamran\nAbassi complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nManchester Evening News breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause\n10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge), Clause 12 (Discrimination), Clause 15\n(Witness payments in criminal trials) and Clause 16 (Payments to criminals) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Drug dealers 'working in\nhomes to recruit kids'”, published on 12 November 2020.2. The\narticle, which appeared across pages 18 and 19, stated that a sister\npublication’s 10-month investigation had uncovered claims that Care 4 Children\n(C4C) staff were grooming children to sell drugs. It stated that the sister\npublication had seen “notes” from a meeting after claims that one child was\n“being exploited by staff via drugs running for them”. The article detailed the\nclaims made by the whistle-blowers including that C4C did not properly act when\nconcerns were raised. It made clear that these charges were denied by C4C, with\nthe article including a statement from C4C.3. The\narticle reported that the sister publication had also sought comment from the\ncomplainant, who was the founder and managing director of C4C, but he had\n“declined to comment”. The article also included a photograph of the\ncomplainant, with the caption identifying him by name. This was published\nalongside a photograph of the exterior of C4C’s offices.4. The\narticle also appeared online in substantially the same form, under the headline\n“Drug dealers 'are working in care homes to recruit kids', investigation\nclaims” , although it additionally reported that C4C had won “£8.8 million\nworth of contracts from Darlington Borough Council to provide residential children’s\nhomes services”.5. The\ncomplainant, who had ceased to occupy the role of Managing Director of C4C in\nSeptember 2020, some weeks prior to the article’s publication, and was not\nmaking a complaint on behalf of the organisation, said that the article was\ninaccurate and misleading, in breach of Clause 1. First, the complainant said\nthat contrary to the online article’s claim, C4C had not won “£8.8m worth of\ncontracts with Darlington Borough Council” to provide children homes services.\nHe said the organisation had won only part of this particular contract, shared\nbetween 17 providers and 5 local authorities. This was part of a multiple\nawardees contract as shown by the tender that was publicly available online.6. Second,\nthe complainant did not accept that there had been a “ten-month investigation”\nby the sister newspaper but rather the article had been based upon information\nobtained from a “disreputable” source. He said that the headline of the article\nhad presented the serious and damaging allegation that drug dealers worked in\nC4C homes as fact.7. Third,\nthe complainant said that the inclusion of the photograph with the caption\nidentifying him by name gave the misimpression that he was involved in illicit\nactivity and discredited him. Furthermore, he expressed concern that the\nreporter from the sister publication had approached him for comment only two\ndays prior to publication and whilst a police investigation into the matter was\nstill ongoing.8. In\naddition, the complainant said that one former employee of C4C, who he believed\nto be the lead whistle-blower, had reportedly made self-admissions to “selling”\nhis story to the investigating newspaper after failing in their attempts to\n“extort” money from the company. Because of this, he said that the material\npublished had been obtained by this individual using “illegal recordings”, in\nbreach of Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge). He also suggested\nthat as a result of the previous convictions of this individual and his\n“deep-rooted connections” to a criminal gang, the publication was in breach of\nClause 16 (Payments to criminals). Though the complainant accepted that the\npolice investigation into the matter had concluded without further action, he\nsaid that the article had been published whilst their investigation was\nongoing, and the whistle-blower could quite conceivably have been called as a\nwitness. As such, he considered it was also in breach of Clause 15 (Witness\npayments in criminal trials).9. The\ncomplainant also said the article breached Clause 2 (Privacy) by publishing a\nphotograph of him in the driveway outside his home, which he accepted was\nvisible from the public street outside, without his consent and permission. He\nquestioned the decision by the newspaper to identify him and suggested that\nthis was influenced to some extent by his race and colour, in breach of Clause\n12.10. The\npublication did not accept any breach of the Editors’ Code. Notwithstanding\nthis, the publication accepted that the online article was inaccurate to report\nthat C4C had won £8.8m worth of contracts with Darlington Borough Council,\namending the text of the article and publishing the footnote correction to\nrecord this:“A\nprevious version of this article stated that 'Care 4 Children Residential\nService Ltd won £8.8 million worth of contracts from Darlington Borough\nCouncil'. In fact, Care 4 Children won part of this contract as part of a\nmultiple awardees contract. We are happy to clarify this.”11.\nWhilst the publication accepted that the complainant’s first point of complaint\nrepresented an inaccuracy, it did not accept that this was significant given\nthat C4C had won part of the contract from the council.12. In\naddition, it did not accept that the complainant’s further concerns raised a\nbreach of Clause 1. It noted that the article made clear that the claims that\ndrug dealers worked in C4C care homes to recruit children was not a claim of\nfact; rather, it was conjecture and presented as such, by way of the use\ninverted commas in the headline and attributing these claims to the\nwhistle-blowers within the text of the article. It noted that the complainant’s\nconcern about the length of the sister newspaper’s investigation was\nspeculative and not based upon any evidence. It added that the article did not\nreport or suggest any wrongdoing on the part of the complainant, with the\ncaption of the disputed image showing his likeness and the text of the article\nclearly indicating his role at the organisation. It denied a breach of Clause\n12.13. In\nregard to the complainant’s privacy concerns under Clause 2, the newspaper\nmaintained that the photograph had been taken in a public place where the\ncomplainant had no reasonable expectation of privacy. It observed that the\ncomplainant had accepted that his driveway, where he had been positioned when\nthe photograph was taken, was clearly visible from the street outside his home,\nand did not reveal any personal information about him other than his likeness.\nIt did not accept a breach of Clause 2.14. The\nnewspaper made clear that it did not accept that the information regarding\nillegal activity at the homes was obtained by subterfuge, in breach of Clause\n10. It said that no “hacking or any other unlawful [or] illicit activity” was\nundertaken by the other publication in order to view and obtain the notes from\nthe internal meeting at C4C. It also explicitly denied the unauthorised removal\nof confidential documents. However, the publication did not provide any further\ninformation in relation to this, citing its obligation to protect the\nwhistle-blowers. Nor did it accept the concerns raised by the complainant in\nrelation to Clause 15 and Clause 16. The newspaper maintained that no payment,\nor offer of payment, had been made to the whistle-blowers and noted that the\ncomplainant had provided no evidence to substantiate the alleged\n‘self-admissions’ made by the person whom he believed to be the lead\nwhistle-blower. It added that in any event Clause 16 did not prohibit anyone\nwith a criminal record receiving payment from a newspaper. The newspaper made\nclear that the article did not attempt to glorify, glamorise, or exploit crime.Relevant\nCode ProvisionsClause 1\n(Accuracy)i) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.ii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. iii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.iv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.Clause 2\n(Privacy)*i)\nEveryone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home,\nhealth and correspondence, including digital communications.ii)\nEditors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private\nlife without consent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy, account will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of\ninformation and the extent to which the material complained about is already in\nthe public domain or will become so.iii) It\nis unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or\nprivate places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.Clause\n10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge)*i) The\npress must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by using hidden\ncameras or clandestine listening devices; or by intercepting private or mobile\ntelephone calls, messages or emails; or by the unauthorised removal of\ndocuments or photographs; or by accessing digitally-held information without\nconsent.ii)\nEngaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or\nintermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then\nonly when the material cannot be obtained by other means.Clause\n12 (Discrimination)i) The\npress must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual's, race,\ncolour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or to any physical\nor mental illness or disability.ii)\nDetails of an individual's race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual\norientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided unless\ngenuinely relevant to the story.Clause\n15 (Witness payments in criminal trials)i) No\npayment or offer of payment to a witness – or any person who may reasonably be\nexpected to be called as a witness – should be made in any case once\nproceedings are active as defined by the Contempt of Court Act 1981. This\nprohibition lasts until the suspect has been freed unconditionally by police\nwithout charge or bail or the proceedings are otherwise discontinued; or has\nentered a guilty plea to the court; or, in the event of a not guilty plea, the\ncourt has announced its verdict.*ii)\nWhere proceedings are not yet active but are likely and foreseeable, editors\nmust not make or offer payment to any person who may reasonably be expected to\nbe called as a witness, unless the information concerned ought demonstrably to\nbe published in the public interest and there is an over-riding need to make or\npromise payment for this to be done; and all reasonable steps have been taken\nto ensure no financial dealings influence the evidence those witnesses give. In\nno circumstances should such payment be conditional on the outcome of a trial.*iii)\nAny payment or offer of payment made to a person later cited to give evidence\nin proceedings must be disclosed to the prosecution and defence. The witness\nmust be advised of this requirement.Clause\n16 (Payment to criminals)i)\nPayment or offers of payment for stories, pictures or information, which seek\nto exploit a particular crime or to glorify or glamorise crime in general, must\nnot be made directly or via agents to convicted or confessed criminals or to\ntheir associates – who may include family, friends and colleagues.ii)\nEditors invoking the public interest to justify payment or offers would need to\ndemonstrate that there was good reason to believe the public interest would be\nserved. If, despite payment, no public interest emerged, then the material\nshould not be published.Findings\nof the Committee15. The\nCommittee was clear that a newspaper’s obligations under the Editors’ Code\nextends to all editorial content it publishes, including material obtained from\nsister publications.16. In\nthis instance, the online article had incorrectly reported that that C4C had\nwon “£8.8m worth of contracts with Darlington Borough Council” to provide\nchildren homes services in February 2020; this was demonstrably incorrect as\nthe award was a matter of public record, with the scope and value of this\ncontract available online. This clearly showed C4C was one of a number of\nproviders awarded the contract. This represented a failure by the newspaper to\ntake care over the accuracy of its statement and it amounted to a significant\ninaccuracy, as it misrepresented the allocation of public money to private\ncompanies for the provision of care. As such, the newspaper was obliged, in\naccordance with the terms of Clause 1 (ii), to correct this promptly and with\ndue prominence. 17. Upon receipt of the complaint, the\nnewspaper had amended the online version of the article, appending a footnote\nto the piece to record this alteration; this footnote identified and corrected\nthe inaccuracy. This put the correct position on record and had been made as\nsoon as the newspaper was notified of the inaccuracy. This footnote correction,\nin conjunction with the amendments to the online article, was published with\nsufficient promptness and the proposed location deemed sufficiently prominent\nthat the terms of Clause 1 (ii) had been met, and there was no breach of Clause\n1 (ii).18. The\ncomplainant expressed concern that the article gave the misleading impression\nthat he was involved in illicit activity by placing an image of him, captioned\nwith his name, alongside an image of a white substance within a plastic bag.\nThe image of the substance was clearly a stock image, to illustrate the broader\nallegations within the article. There was no suggestion that the complainant\nwas involved in any “drug dealing” activities; his connection to the story was\nmade clear in the text of the article. As such, the Committee did not find a\nbreach of Clause 1 on this point.19. The\ncomplainant had also expressed concern under Clause 1 that the sister newspaper\nhad approached him for comment only two days prior to the publication of the\narticle whilst a police investigation was ongoing. There is no obligation\nimposed by the Editors’ Code for newspapers to approach individuals for comment\nprior to their inclusion in an article. Rather, Clause 1 (i) requires publications\nto “take care” not to publish inaccurate or misleading information; in some\ninstances, a publication will need to put allegations to an individual in order\nto meet this obligation, but this will not be necessary in all cases. In this\ninstance, the sister publication had approached the complainant for comment two\ndays before publication, which the Committee considered was adequate time for\nhim to respond. In addition, the Committee noted that the complainant had not\nidentified any inaccurate or misleading allegations about him included in the\narticle which he suggested should have been put to him for comment prior to\npublication. Furthermore, when the sister publication had contacted his\nrepresentatives, it had been informed that the complainant did not intend to\nengage with its enquiries. This was made clear in the both the online and print\narticles. In these circumstances, the Committee did not consider that the\ntiming or manner of the sister publication’s approach to the complainant\ndemonstrated a failure to take care and did not, therefore, find a breach of\nthe Editors’ Code on this point.20.\nClause 2 is designed to ensure that an individual’s private and family life is\nrespected. The complainant said that the newspaper had breached his privacy by\nobtaining and publishing a photograph of him in his drive, without his\npermission and consent. It was accepted by the complainant that his driveway\nwas visible from the public road. The Committee did not consider that the\ncomplainant had a reasonable expectation of privacy while standing in a drive\nthat was visible from the road. The Committee also noted that the published\nphotograph disclosed only the complainant’s likeness; it did not disclose any\nprivate information and did not show him engaged in private activity.\nFurthermore, it identified him in the context of his previous professional role\nwith C4C; this was not private information. In such circumstances, the\nCommittee did not consider that the publication of the photograph represented\nan intrusion into the complainant’s private life. There was no breach of Clause\n2.21.\nClause 12 relates to prejudicial, pejorative, or irrelevant references to an\nindividual’s protected characteristic. In this instance, the article did not\ncontain any such reference to a protected characteristic of the complainant.\nThere was no breach of Clause 12.22. The\nCommittee noted that the complainant had raised further concerns over the\naccuracy of the allegations against C4C and the nature of the sister publication’s\ninvestigation, particularly in relation to the manner in which the information\ncontained in the article had been obtained, citing Clauses 10, 15 and 16 in his\ncomplaint. In circumstances where these points related specifically to C4C, its\nemployees and the sister newspaper’s investigation of the organisation, the\nCommittee considered that it would require the direct involvement of C4C – or\nits authorised representative – in order to be in a position to make a ruling\non these points of complaint. The complainant had confirmed that he was neither\nacting on behalf nor with the consent of C4C. In the absence of C4C’s\ninvolvement, the Committee could not consider these aspects of the complaint\nand therefore made no ruling on the points raised.Conclusions23. The\ncomplaint was upheld in part under Clause 1.Remedial\nAction Required24. The\nnewspaper had amended the online article and published a footnote correction,\nwhich identified the inaccuracy and put the correct position on record. No further\naction was required.\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 23/11/2020\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 28/10/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
