Martin Phillips complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that The Sunday Times breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Living room overpowers\nkitchen to become new energy hub of the home”, published on 11 June 2017.\n2. The article reported on the trend in energy consumption\nwithin Britain, and compared the energy use of devices located in kitchens and\nliving rooms in the average household.\n3. The complainant said that the article reported inaccurate\nfigures for costs and power consumption of the household items.\n4. The newspaper said that the figures had been provided by\na PR agency acting for British Gas, however it accepted that it had been\nprovided with the incorrect figures. The newspaper apologised for the error and\npublished an apology in print on page 20, which directed readers to the correct\nfigures which it had published online. It also removed the original online\narticle.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\n(i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\n(ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published.

The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n7. Following IPSO’s intervention the newspaper published the\ncorrect figures and an apology in print.\n8. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto his satisfaction.\n9. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 06/07/2017Date complaint concluded: 08/08/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
