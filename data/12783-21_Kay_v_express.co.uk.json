Anthony\nKay complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nexpress.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 3 (Harassment) and Clause 12\n(Discrimination) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined\n“Unvaccinated DON’T get to live the lives the rest of us do, blasts CAROLE\nMALONE”, published on 11 December 2021.\n2. The\narticle was a comment piece which commented on a weekend the writer spent in\nCopenhagen. The article praised Denmark’s current approach to Covid-19\nrestrictions and suggested that its population understood that for the country\nto stay open you need to be vaccinated. It further argued that “As for the 5m\nadults [Brits] still refusing the jab – they’re the reason we’re all at risk of\nrestrictions. It’s these people who’ll put a strain on the NHS if they catch\ncovid not the vaccinated who are unlikely to be hospitalised. This country\nremains vulnerable because of THEIR human rights.” The article also asked the\nreader to “See how much good [people who refused the vaccine’s] human rights\nare when they're strapped to a ventilator gasping for breath”.\n3. The\ncomplainant said the article was inaccurate to refer to the “5m adults [Brits]\nstill refusing the jab” as figures published by the UKHSA shortly after the\npublication of the article suggested that 23.5 million people in England had\nnot received any doses of the vaccine. The complainant said that if one\ndeducted the population of children who are not eligible, that left 15 million\npeople – three times the number referred to in the article. The complainant\nalso disputed the claim that people who chose not to be vaccinated were “the\nreason we’re all at risk of restrictions. It’s these people who’ll put a strain\non the NHS if they catch covid not the vaccinated who are unlikely to be\nhospitalised. This country remains vulnerable because of THEIR human rights” as\nit attributed blame to the unvaccinated and omitted to mention that the vaccine\ndoes not prevent infection or transmission. The complainant further added that\nthe UKHSA figures indicated that “four out of five Covid-19 deaths in the last\nmonth occurred among the double and triple vaccinated”, and noted that at the\ntime of his original complaint, the most recent variant had only been found in\nthe vaccinated, and the majority of Covid-19 patients in hospital at that time\nwere vaccinated. He also said that the language used in the article was\ninsensitive.\n4. The\ncomplainant also said the article breached Clause 3 and Clause 12 because it\nshamed and demonised those who have chosen not to receive the vaccine.\n5. The\npublication did not accept a breach of the Code. The newspaper commented that\nthe 5 million figure had been widely reported at the time of publication and\nprovided several examples of where this figure had been reported by different\nnewspapers.\n6. The\npublication also said that since the article was published, the complainant's\nsuggested figure of 23.5 million unvaccinated people had been investigated and\ndebunked by a fact-checking website, which also reported the figure of\napproximately 5 million as quoted in Carole's column. The publication quoted\nthe report which said: “To estimate the size of the population eligible for\nvaccination, the government uses the ONS estimate for the population aged 12\nand over, which is 48,375,273. With 43,250,509 first doses having been given in\nEngland, that would leave an estimated 5.1 million eligible people who have not\nreceived a dose of vaccine.“\n7. The\nfact-checking report stated that the number of unvaccinated peopled was\ndependent on which population estimate was used, but that either population\nestimate gave a result of “considerably lower” than 23.5 million. The report\nclaimed that The Office for National Statistics (ONS) had estimated that the\npopulation was 55.6 million, in its latest estimate of 2020, whereas the UKHSA counted\n62,724,319 people in England registered with the NHS. The report made clear\nthat neither data set was infallible, but that the government used the ONS\nestimate. This gave the figure of 5.1 million eligible people who had not\nreceived a dose of the vaccine in England.\n8. The\npublication said that the article was an opinion piece and was clearly\npresented as such. The publication also stated that while vaccinations did not\ncompletely reduce the risk of infection and transmission of Covid, multiple\nstudies had found that vaccines had an impact on the chances of catching or\ntransmitting Covid-19 and that vaccinations lowered the risk of transmission\nand infection of the virus, including the severity of symptoms\n9. The\npublication did not accept that article breached Clause 3 and Clause 12 as they\nwere not engaged.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 3\n(Harassment)*\ni)\nJournalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit.\nii) They\nmust not persist in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing\nindividuals once asked to desist; nor remain on property when asked to leave\nand must not follow them.

The\nCommittee considered the disputed figure of 5 million eligible unvaccinated\nBritons. It acknowledged that this figure had been widely reported during the\ntime the article was published and that the publication had provided several\nexamples of contemporaneous articles which also published the figure.\n11. The\nCommittee further noted that the fact-checking report calculated two possible\nestimates of this figure based on two data sets which had forecast two\ndifferent figures of the English population. The publication highlighted the\ndata in the report which was based on the ONS’s estimate of the population\nwhich concluded that there were approximately 5.1 million eligible people in\nEngland who were unvaccinated\n12. The\nCommittee recognised that the widely reported 5 million figure was based on an\nestimation of the population, for which there were different approximations.\nHowever, where the UK government used the ONS data to calculate the population,\nand where the 5 million figure had been widely reported, the Committee did not\nconsider the figure of 5 million Britons to be significantly inaccurate and\nthere was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n13. The\nCommittee understood that the complainant also believed that it was inaccurate\nto claim that the unvaccinated were “the reason we’re all at risk of\nrestrictions. It’s these people who’ll put a strain on the NHS if they catch\ncovid not the vaccinated who are unlikely to be hospitalised” as it did not\nmention that vaccinated people were also able to contract Covid-19 and infect\nothers. The Committee noted that the article did not make any claims that the\nvaccine prevented infection and transmission, but rather noted that the\n“strain” referred to by the columnist related to the higher likelihood of\nhospitalisation among the unvaccinated. As the publication had noted, multiple\nstudies existed which showed vaccines decrease the severity of Covid-19\nsymptoms and, as such, the Committee was satisfied that there was a basis for\nthis claim. The Committee also had regard for context in which the claim\nappeared: it was clearly presented as a comment piece and therefore necessarily\nreflected the columnist’s interpretation of the situation.  The Committee also made clear that, while the\ncomplainant found the article to be insensitive, this did not make the article\nmisleading or inaccurate. There was no breach of Clause 1 on these points.\n14. With\nregards to the complaint under Clause 3, the complainant believed the article\nwas demonising and shaming towards the unvaccinated. Clause 3 generally relates\nto the way journalists behave when gathering news, including the nature and\nextent of their contacts with the subject of the story. As the complainant’s\nconcerns did not relate to this, there was no breach of Clause 3.\n15. The\ncomplainant said that the article breached Clause 12, again, as he considered\nthat the publication demonised and shamed the unvaccinated. As Clause 12 is\ndesigned to protect specific individuals mentioned by the press from discrimination\nbased on their race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation or\nany physical or mental illness or disability. The complainant’s concern did not\nrelate to an individual, nor is choosing not to take the Covid vaccination a\nprotected characteristic. There was no breach of Clause 12.\nConclusion(s)\n16. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n17. N/A\n \nDate\ncomplaint received: 12/12/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 05/05/2022\n \nIndependent\nComplaints Reviewer\nThe\ncomplainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process\nfollowed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent Complaints\nReviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold the request\nfor review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
