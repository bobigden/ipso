A woman complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that telegraph.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 4\n(Intrusion into grief or shock) and Clause 5 (Reporting of suicide) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article published on 30 September.2. The article\nreported on the death of the complainant’s daughter.3. The complainant\nsaid that the article included a photograph of someone other than her daughter.4. While the\npublication said that it was within its rights to publish a report on the\ninquest proceedings, it accepted that the article included a photograph of the\nwrong person.Relevant Code provisions5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published.Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings.Clause 5 (Reporting Suicide)When reporting suicide, to prevent simulative acts care\nshould be taken to avoid excessive detail of the method used, while taking into\naccount the media's right to report legal proceedings.Mediated outcome6.
