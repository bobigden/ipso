Ravi Ram complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that an article headlined “Southall man cleared of harassing\nformer girlfriend via What’s App messages”, published on\nwww.getwestlondon.co.uk on 10 October 2014, was inaccurate in breach of Clause\n1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice. He also raised concerns that the\nnewspaper was discriminatory in breach of Clause 12 (Discrimination). \n2. The article reported that the complainant had been\nacquitted of harassment without violence at Willesden Magistrates’ Court. It\nexplained that the complainant had originally admitted harassment, but changed\nhis plea to not guilty before sentencing, and that he was found to have no case\nto answer because new evidence had been supplied. \n3. An earlier version of the article had contained a\nparagraph detailing information about the new evidence. The complainant had\ncontacted the newspaper to inform them of an inaccuracy of chronology in the\nparagraph in question, and raised a concern that he was named in the article\nwhen his former girlfriend was not named. The newspaper apologised for the\nerror in relation to the date, and removed the paragraph from the article. The\nnewspaper explained that it had not published the name of the complainant’s former\ngirlfriend because it had not received confirmation from the Criminal\nProsecution Service that there were no reporting restrictions preventing\npublication. The complainant subsequently contacted the newspaper to ask that a\ncorrected version of the paragraph be restored to the article. The newspaper\nresponded that it would update the story once it had spoken with the CPS. The\nnewspaper later explained that the paragraph in question had been based on\nmaterial provided by the complainant’s barrister, and it was removed because\nthe CPS had not confirmed this information. \n4. The complainant said that the article was misleading\nbecause, whilst it reported that he had previously pleaded guilty, it did not\nexplain the reason why he was subsequently acquitted. \n5. The complainant considered that he had been the subject\nof discrimination on the basis of his gender because of the nature of the\ncoverage and the decision to leave out his former girlfriend’s name. \n6. The newspaper said that the article made clear that Mr\nRam was acquitted and that the court found he had no case to answer, and that\nthe removal of the further information did not make the article misleading. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving the\nRegulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance. \n8. Clause 12 (Discrimination) \ni) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference\nto an individual's race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or to any\nphysical or mental illness or disability. \nii) Details of an individual's race, colour, religion,\nsexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided\nunless genuinely relevant to the story. \nFindings of the Committee\n9. The Committee noted the complainant’s concern that the\namended article was misleading because it did not include the details of his\ndefence. The selection of material for inclusion in articles is at the\ndiscretion of the editor, so long as those editorial decisions do not render\narticles significantly inaccurate or misleading.  The article had made clear that the\ncomplainant had been acquitted and that the court had found he had no case to\nanswer. The article was not misleading, and there was no breach of Clause 1. \n10. The Committee noted the complainant’s concern that the\narticle had discriminated against him on the grounds of his gender. The article\ndid not contain pejorative, prejudicial or irrelevant reference to the\ncomplainant’s gender. There was no breach of Clause 12. \nConclusions\n11. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A\n \nDate complaint received: 15/10/2014 \nDate decision issued: 12/01/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
