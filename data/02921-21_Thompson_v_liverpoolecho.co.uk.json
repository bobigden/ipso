Kevin\nThompson complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nliverpoolecho.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Selfie taking cocaine dealers who loved\nposing for the camera”, published on 14 March 2021.\n2. The\narticle, which appeared online only, included short summaries describing the\noffences of individuals who had been convicted of drugs-related offences, and\nany further developments in the circumstances of those individuals. A summary\nrelating to the complainant reported that a woman had claimed that he had sent\nan explicit ‘Snapchat’ to her, which showed his genitalia, “while serving a\njail sentence”. It also reported that he “boasted about his drug-dealing\nexploits in messages to the woman, saying he had ‘big connections in\nLiverpool’”.\n3. The\narticle then reported that the woman “phoned and emailed” the prison facility\nwhere the complainant was incarcerated “to report the matter, which led to [the\ncomplainant] being moved from the open prison to a Category B facility”.\nPhotograph captions also stated that the complainant “was placed on report\nafter sending an explicit photograph to a mum while behind bars”. The summary\nalso included a quotation from a “Prison service spokesperson, [who] said:\n‘Anyone found with a mobile phone in prison is subject to additional\npunishments - including spending longer behind bars.’” The article was based in\npart on a 2019 article which detailed the complainant’s offences.\n4. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. He said\nthat he had not told a woman that he had “big connections in Liverpool”, and he\nhad not been moved “from an open prison to a Category B facility”; he had in\nfact been moved to a Category C facility. He also said that he had not been\nmoved for sending Snapchat messages, as he considered the article implied;\ninstead, he had been moved for having a phone in his possession.\n5. The\ncomplainant also said that the publication could not possibly know that he was\nplaced on report, as the Prison Service would not release such information to\nthe press. He therefore considered the article inaccurate in its reporting of\nhim having been placed “on report” following the Snapchat messages.\n6. The\ncomplainant also said that the article was one-sided, did not include his side\nof the story, and the Prison Service and courts had not commented on the\nspecifics of the story and allegations. He said that the article was based on\nhearsay, and that he did not consider that the publication had taken any steps\nto verify the allegations against him\n7. The\npublication said it did not accept that the article breached the Code. It said\nthat while the original Snapchat message stating that the complainant had “big\nconnections in Liverpool” had been deleted – as was the norm with Snapchat\nmessages – the woman had said in an interview with a reporter that she had\nreceived a message which said this. The publication provided the reporter’s\nnotes to demonstrate that this was the case. The woman had also provided the\nreporter with photographs of the complainant, which it said had been sent via\nSnapchat to the woman, as well as a voice note sent via the app, which the\npublication also provided to IPSO. It said it was satisfied, therefore, that it\nhad taken care over the accuracy of the claim that the complainant had said\nthat he had “big connections in Liverpool”, where it had reporter’s notes of\nthe original interview from the woman, and she had provided additional\ninformation which supported her claims.\n8. The\npublication provided an email from the Prison Service, which stated that the\ncomplainant had been placed on report. It did not, therefore, accept that it\nwas inaccurate for the article to state that the complainant had been placed on\nreport.\n9. The\npublication accepted that it was inaccurate to report that the complainant had\nbeen moved to a “Category B” facility. However, it said it had received this\ninformation from a trusted source and that it did not consider the inaccuracy\nto be so significant such as to require correction under the terms of Clause 1\n(ii). Notwithstanding this, it said that it would be happy to amend the online\narticle to make clear that the complainant had in fact been moved to a Category\nC facility.\n10. The\npublication also said that the article did not claim that the complainant had\nbeen placed on report for sending the Snapchat messages, and noted that the\nstatement from the prison spokesperson referred to “additional punishments”\narising from prisoners being found to be in possession of a phone.\n11. It\nalso said that, directly before the initial 2019 article had been published, a\nreporter working for the publication had contacted the Prison Service for\ncomment on the complainant’s case, and the email requesting comment referenced\nthe complainant by name. The response received from the Prison Service was\nincluded in the 2021 article under complaint.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n12. The\nCommittee understood that there was a dispute between the two parties over\nexactly what messages had been sent, and the content of those messages. The\nCommittee noted that it was not in a position to resolve this dispute and to\nmake a finding on exactly what the content of the messages were. Rather, its\nrole was to find whether the publication had taken care over the accuracy of\nthe information included in the article, and whether the article included any\nsignificant inaccuracies in need of correction.\n13. A\nwoman had told the newspaper in 2019 that she had received several messages\nfrom the complainant, including one in which he said that he had “big\nconnections in Liverpool”. This was supported by contemporaneous reporter’s\nnotes provided by the newspaper, as well as supporting information provided by\nthe woman: ‘selfies’ showing the complainant and voicemail recordings. In\naddition, the newspaper had approached the Prison Service for comment on the\nallegations, as it could not contact the complainant directly at the time.\nWhere the publication had put the allegations to the prison service, and had\nprovided both reporter’s notes and supplementary information to support the\nwoman’s account, the Committee found that it had taken care over the accuracy\nof the claim that the complainant had told the woman that he had “big\nconnections in Liverpool” and that no significant inaccuracy in need of\ncorrection arose from reporting this. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this\npoint.\n14. The\npublication had accepted that it was inaccurate to report that the complainant\nhad been moved to a Category B prison – he had in fact been moved to a Category\nC prison –  and the question for the\nCommittee was whether the article had been significantly inaccurate on this\npoint.  It was not in dispute that the\ncomplainant had been moved from an open to a closed prison environment and that\nthis had occurred after the woman had contacted the prison authorities, as\nreported.  The Committee did not consider\nthat the difference between a Category B prison and a Category C prison was\nsignificant in circumstances where both categories were closed prison\nenvironments and the reference in the article served to illustrate that the\ncomplainant’s circumstances had changed as a result of the matter having been\nraised with the prison authorities.  \nThere was no breach of Clause 1. Whilst there was no obligation under\nthe Code to correct the point, the Committee nevertheless welcomed the\npublication’s offer to amend this detail.\n15. The\narticle did not report that the complainant had been moved for sending Snapchat\nmessages, and said only that it was the woman’s reporting of the matter “which\nled to [the complainant] being moved”. Read in conjunction with the Prison\nService’s statement that “[a]nyone found with a mobile phone in prison is\nsubject to additional punishments”, the Committee did not consider that the\narticle inaccurately reported that the complainant had been moved for sending\nSnapchats, rather than being in possession of a phone. There was no breach of\nClause 1 on this point.\n16. In\nthe Prison Service’s response to the newspaper in 2019, it had confirmed that\nthe complainant had been placed on report. It was not, therefore, inaccurate,\nmisleading, or distorted for the newspaper to report this, and there was no\nbreach of Clause 1 on this point.\n17.  Finally, the Committee noted that concerns\nthat a story is biased, one-sided, or based on hearsay generally don’t raise a\npossible breach of the Code – provided a newspaper takes care not to publish\ninaccurate, misleading, or distorted information, and any information which is\nsignificantly inaccurate, misleading, or distorted is corrected. In certain\ncases, there may also be the need to offer individuals the right to reply to\nsignificant inaccuracies. In this case, the publication was able to demonstrate\nthat it had taken care over the information included in the article, and none\nof the points raised by the complainants amounted to significant inaccuracies.\nIn addition, while the complainant had not been approached directly for comment\nin relation to the allegations, the Committee noted that he had been\nincarcerated at the time, which restricted the newspaper’s ability to seek his\ncomment. It had, instead, sought comment from the Prison Service in relation to\nthe allegations, and the Prison Service’s comment was included in the article.\nAs such, the complainant’s concerns that the article was biased, one-sided, and\nbased on hearsay did not raise a breach of Clause 1.\nConclusions\n18. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n19. N/A\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 22/03/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 19/11/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
