Mesbeh Mouelhi complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that The Sun had breached Clause 3 (Privacy) and Clause\n12 (Discrimination) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in article headlined\n“Tunisian toyboy left me broke…so I got another”, published on 31 July 2014. \n2. The article told the story of the complainant’s partner’s\nformer husband, to whom she said she had given her life savings before deciding\nto seek a divorce. She had been in a relationship with the complainant at the\ntime of publication, and the article noted that both men were young and\nTunisian. \n3. The complainant said that the newspaper had published\nphotographs of him without his consent, and he had not given permission for his\npersonal details to be published. He said that this breached Clause 3. He also\nsaid that the article had prompted people to criticise him, but did not explain\nfurther why this constituted a breach of Clause 12. \n4. The newspaper said that the complainant’s partner had\nsigned a contract with the news agency which had sold the story to the\nnewspaper, and had been paid for the pictures she had provided. It said that it\nbelieved that the complainant’s partner had a right to tell her story, and that\nit appeared that she had been happy with the article, after publication. It\nsaid that the story had previously appeared in a magazine, and so was in the\npublic domain. \n5. With regard to Clause 12, it said that nothing in the\narticle was discriminatory, critical, or pejorative of the complainant; it\nnoted that the complainant, like the woman’s previous husband, was Tunisian.\nThe article had been positive about the complainant, and had noted that he had\npaid for the woman’s divorce. \n6. Nonetheless, it offered to remove the article from the\nnewspaper’s website, as a gesture of goodwill. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 3 (Privacy) \ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including pictures. \nClause 12 (Discrimination) \ni) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference\nto an individual’s race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or to any\nphysical or mental illness or disability. \nii) Details of an individual’s race, colour, religion,\nsexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided\nunless genuinely relevant to the story. \nFindings of the Committee\n8. The article under complaint was the story of the\ncomplainant’s partner’s relationships. She was entitled to tell her story, in\naccordance with her right to freedom of expression. While the Committee\nacknowledged the complainant’s concern about the inclusion of details which he\nconsidered to be personal, in light of the nature of the information and the\nfact that it had been provided to the newspaper by his partner, the Committee\nconcluded that the publication of this information did not raise a breach of\nClause 3. \n9. The complainant’s partner had also provided the\nphotograph of the complainant to the newspaper, and she had been remunerated\nfor its use; it had not been obtained in a way which intruded into his privacy.\nFurther, it did not reveal any information about him which would be considered\nprivate under the terms of Clause 3. There was no breach of Clause 3. \n10. While it was regrettable that the complainant had\nreceived criticism following publication of the article, this would not in\nitself engage the terms of Clause 12. \nConclusions\n11. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 07/10/2014 \nDate decision issued: 20/02/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
