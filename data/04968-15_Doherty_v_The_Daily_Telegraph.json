The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. It noted that headlines should be considered in the context of full articles, as they only provide a summary of the content, and said that the use of single quotation marks in the print headline was a journalistic convention, indicating that an allegation had been made. It said that the article had made clear that travellers had not “moved into” the site, but that Mr Knott was concerned about a “proposed” site. Furthermore, the proposed dwellings would have been Mr Knott’s closest neighbours on one side of his property. It said that the article had made clear the verdict of the inquest, and it was not misleading to make reference to a “suicide pact”, as the Coroner had heard evidence on this point. The newspaper did not accept that the discrepancy between “unlawful death” and “unlawful killing” represented a significant inaccuracy.  10. The newspaper did not accept that evidence had been inaccurately reported. The friend of the couple and the police officer had made the statements attributed to them. It was clear from the evidence given that both parties believed the planning application was a factor in the deaths, and other evidence heard at the inquest had referred to Mr Knott’s concern about the planning application. The Coroner had also made reference to it. The newspaper did not accept that its report suggested that this was the only factor. It noted that the purpose of an inquest is to establish the cause of death, and not to establish precisely why Mr Knott acted in the way that he did.  Relevant Code Provisions 11. Clause 1 (Accuracy)  i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information, including pictures.  ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and – where appropriate – an apology published.  iii) The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.  Findings of the Committee 12. The Committee noted that the purpose of the inquest had not been to establish the motivations for Mr Knott’s actions; nor would it be appropriate for the Committee to make a judgment on this. Rather, the Committee considered whether the articles were accurate reports of the inquest proceedings.  13. The Committee had reviewed a transcript of the inquest proceedings, which included the evidence reported in the article. The complainant had expressed concern that the presentation of this evidence and the omission of other comments made by those quoted rendered the article misleading and distorted in relation to the evidence heard. In this instance, both versions of the article had made clear that the inquest had heard that Mr Knott was concerned about his wife’s health and about the planning application, and the newspaper was entitled to report evidence that related to the latter concern. The articles had made clear that both concerns were important to Mr Knott, with both noting that he could not cope with the stress of the camp “and his wife’s failing health”. The online article had referred to evidence that he had a file “three-inch thick file” on the planning application, in contrast to one “a foot thick” on his wife’s health. It was not misleading to report that Mr Knott had concerns about the planning application; this had been heard at the inquest. In circumstances where the text of both articles had made clear that it was not the sole concern, the publication was entitled to focus on one aspect of the evidence.  14. While the text of both versions of the article had made clear the findings of the inquest, the print headline was not an accurate summary of any evidence heard during proceedings. The Committee noted the newspaper’s position that the use of single quotation marks was a journalistic convention, to denote the paraphrasing of an allegation, and accepted that the meaning of quotation marks can vary according to context, and is therefore open to interpretation. However, the headline was not supported by evidence heard at the inquest, in whole or by any individual; the inquest had not heard or found that Mr Knott’s concern about the camp had been the cause of his death (rather than a contributing factor). The headline was significantly inaccurate and breached Clause 1 (i). The Committee considered whether the newspaper had further breached Clause 1 (ii) by declining to offer to publish a correction or clarification on this point. It noted that it had accepted that the headline was open to interpretation, albeit it had not accepted the interpretation advanced by the newspaper. In these circumstances, the fact that the newspaper had not recognised the inaccuracy, and had not therefore offered a prompt correction, was not, in the Committee’s view, deserving of further censure as a breach of 1 (ii). However, the inaccuracy must now be corrected to avoid a breach.  15. The Committee expressed some concern that, in the online article, two statements made separately by a witness had been reported consecutively, to suggest that she had said that Mr Knott was “at the end of his tether” as a result of the planning application. However, in circumstance where the quotations as published had made clear that the witness believed that Mr Knott was concerned about his wife’s health, as well as the application, and taken in the context of the article as a whole, the Committee did not consider that the presentation of the evidence represented a distortion of the evidence heard.  16. The Committee was satisfied that the articles had made clear that no travellers had yet moved into the site, and that Mr Knott’s concerns related to a planning application. The proposed site was on land adjacent to Mr Knott’s property; it was not therefore misleading to refer to it as “next door”.  17. In circumstances where the articles had made the verdict returned by the Coroner, it was not misleading to refer to evidence heard at the inquest in relation to the reasons for Mr Knott’s motivations, and whether he and his wife had carried out a “suicide pact”.  18. While the Committee acknowledged that the term “after”, as used in the online headline, could be ambiguous, it was satisfied that the headline, when taken in conjunction with the sub-heading, and text of the full article, was not inaccurate.  19. The Committee noted that the verdict of the Coroner was “unlawful killing” rather than “unlawful death”. However, it did not consider that this was a significant distinction in this context; the article had made clear that Mr Knott had taken Mrs Knott’s life unlawfully.  Conclusions 20. The complaint was upheld in relation to the print article.",

    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\n·        Decision of the Complaints Committee 04968-15 Doherty\nv The Daily Telegraph\nSummary of\ncomplaint \n1. Mike Doherty of the Traveller Movement complained to\nthe Independent Press Standards Organisation that The Daily Telegraph breached\nClause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an online article\nheadlined “Retired couple carry out suicide pact after travellers move in next\ndoor”,  published on 8 April 2015. He also complained about the print\nversion of the article, headlined “Gipsy camp stress ‘drove couple to suicide\npact’”, published on 9 April 2015. \n2. The articles, a brief print piece and longer online\nversion, reported the inquest into the deaths of John and Elizabeth Knott. Mr\nKnott had killed his wife before taking his own life. Both articles reported\nthat, prior to his death, Mr Knott had been concerned about a planning\napplication to establish a site for a traveller family on a field close to his\nhome. \n3. The print article noted that the Coroner had returned\na verdict of unlawful killing and suicide. It stated that Mr Knott and his wife\nhad “carried out a suicide pact after travellers bought a plot of land next\ndoor” to their home, and that the inquest had heard that Mr Knott “could not\ncope with the stress of the new travellers’ camp and his wife’s failing\nhealth”. It included quotations from evidence heard at the inquest, including a\ncomment from a friend of the couple, who had said that “[Mr Knott] was at the\nend of his tether, and felt he had lost his wife both physically and mentally”. \n4. The online article, which carried the sub-headline\n“Inquest hears retired construction executive John Knott could not cope with\nthe stress of the new travellers’ camp and his wife’s failing health”, had\nreported the verdict as “unlawful death and suicide”. It included evidence\nheard at the inquest, and noted that a friend of the couple had stated that Mr\nKnott “was concerned” that a field next to his cottage was going to be built\non, and that he was “at the end of his tether and felt he had lost his wife\nboth physically and mentally”. It also reported that a police officer had told\nthe inquest that the proposed site “was clearly a concern” to Mr Knott, and\nthat the inquest had heard that Mr Knott kept a “three-inch thick file”\ndetailing his fight against the planning application, and a file “a foot thick”\non his wife’s health. \n5. The complainant expressed a general concern that the\narticles had exaggerated the extent to which Mr Knott’s concern about the\nplanning application had led to the deaths. He said this was misleading; the\ncoroner had made no reference to the planning application in his concluding\nremarks. He also said that to report that the deaths had taken place “after”\nthe land had been bought by a travelling family inaccurately suggested\ncausation, rather than chronology. He expressed further concern about the print\nheadline, which he believed presented conjecture as fact. The complainant was\nconcerned that inaccurate reporting of this story could contribute to prejudice\nagainst the traveller community. \n6. The complainant said that the articles contained a\nnumber of other inaccuracies. He said that no travellers had “moved in” to the\nproposed site, as reported in the online article, nor was it “next door” to Mr\nKnott’s property; a planning application had been made to allow a single family\nto live on a site at the far end of an adjacent field. He also said that the\ninquest had not established that Mr Knott and his wife had carried out a\nsuicide pact. To report this as fact was inaccurate, and represented a failure\nto distinguish between conjecture and fact. \n7. The complainant said that evidence heard at the\ninquest had been reported in a misleading manner. He said that a friend of the\ncouple, who had given evidence at the inquest, had not made the reference to Mr\nKnott being “at the end of his tether” in relation to the planning application,\nas the online article implied. The references to this planning application and\nto Mr Knott being “at the end of his tether” had not been made consecutively.\nThe complainant said that it was misleading to place these two phrases together\nin the online article, as it suggested that the friend had said that Mr Knott\nwas “at the end of his tether” due to his concerns about the planning\napplication. He also said that it was misleading for the online article not to\ninclude the police officer’s comment that Mr Knott’s “concern for his wife’s\nhealth weighed more heavily on his mind [than the planning application]”. The\ncomplainant provided a transcript of the inquest proceedings in support of his\ncomplaint. \n8. The complainant also said that the online article had\ninaccurately reported the conclusions of the Coroner; there was no such thing\nas unlawful death; the verdict in relation to Mrs Knott’s death was unlawful\nkilling. \n9. The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. It\nnoted that headlines should be considered in the context of full articles, as\nthey only provide a summary of the content, and said that the use of single\nquotation marks in the print headline was a journalistic convention, indicating\nthat an allegation had been made. It said that the article had made clear that\ntravellers had not “moved into” the site, but that Mr Knott was concerned about\na “proposed” site. Furthermore, the proposed dwellings would have been Mr\nKnott’s closest neighbours on one side of his property. It said that the\narticle had made clear the verdict of the inquest, and it was not misleading to\nmake reference to a “suicide pact”, as the Coroner had heard evidence on this\npoint. The newspaper did not accept that the discrepancy between “unlawful\ndeath” and “unlawful killing” represented a significant inaccuracy. \n10. The newspaper did not accept that evidence had been\ninaccurately reported. The friend of the couple and the police officer had made\nthe statements attributed to them. It was clear from the evidence given that\nboth parties believed the planning application was a factor in the deaths, and\nother evidence heard at the inquest had referred to Mr Knott’s concern about\nthe planning application. The Coroner had also made reference to it. The\nnewspaper did not accept that its report suggested that this was the only\nfactor. It noted that the purpose of an inquest is to establish the cause of\ndeath, and not to establish precisely why Mr Knott acted in the way that he\ndid. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n11. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \niii) The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nFindings of the Committee\n12.

The Committee considered whether the newspaper had\nfurther breached Clause 1 (ii) by declining to offer to publish a correction or\nclarification on this point. It noted that it had accepted that the headline\nwas open to interpretation, albeit it had not accepted the interpretation\nadvanced by the newspaper. In these circumstances, the fact that the newspaper\nhad not recognised the inaccuracy, and had not therefore offered a prompt\ncorrection, was not, in the Committee’s view, deserving of further censure as a\nbreach of 1 (ii). However, the inaccuracy must now be corrected to avoid a\nbreach. \n15. The Committee expressed some concern that, in the\nonline article, two statements made separately by a witness had been reported\nconsecutively, to suggest that she had said that Mr Knott was “at the end of\nhis tether” as a result of the planning application. However, in circumstance\nwhere the quotations as published had made clear that the witness believed that\nMr Knott was concerned about his wife’s health, as well as the application, and\ntaken in the context of the article as a whole, the Committee did not consider\nthat the presentation of the evidence represented a distortion of the evidence\nheard. \n16.

The proposed site was on land\nadjacent to Mr Knott’s property; it was not therefore misleading to refer to it\nas “next door”. \n17. In circumstances where the articles had made the\nverdict returned by the Coroner, it was not misleading to refer to evidence\nheard at the inquest in relation to the reasons for Mr Knott’s motivations, and\nwhether he and his wife had carried out a “suicide pact”. \n18. While the Committee acknowledged that the term\n“after”, as used in the online headline, could be ambiguous, it was satisfied\nthat the headline, when taken in conjunction with the sub-heading, and text of\nthe full article, was not inaccurate. \n19.

In order to remedy the breach of Clause 1 (i), the\nnewspaper should publish a correction, which should make clear that the quotation\nin the print headline was not a summary of evidence heard at the inquest. In\naddition, the correction should acknowledge that it had been published\nfollowing a ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation.
