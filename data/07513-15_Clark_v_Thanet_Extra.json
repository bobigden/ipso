It quoted from the victim impact statement\nof a witness, read out in court, who said that she and her daughter had also\nseen the complainant masturbating in his car. It reported that the complainant\nhad admitted outraging public decency and drink driving, but denied\nmasturbating.3.\nThe online article was substantively similar to the print version, but it did\nnot contain any reference to the allegation that the complainant had been masturbating.4.\nThe complainant said that he attended court on 14 August to answer charges of\ndrink driving and exposure. While he admitted the drink driving charge, and\nconceded he was naked at the time, he denied masturbating. However, he agreed\nto plead guilty to a lesser charge of outraging public decency for being seen\nnaked in his car if the exposure charge in relation to the masturbation was\nwithdrawn; he said that this offer was accepted by the prosecution in order to\navoid a Newton hearing to establish the facts of the case prior to sentencing.\nThe complainant said that when his sentencing hearing took place on 5\nSeptember, the prosecutor started to read out the victim impact statement of\nthe witness who said she had seen him masturbating, but the court’s legal\nadvisor reminded the prosecutor that that particular charge had been withdrawn\nat court on 14 August. He said that the legal advisor told the court, including\nthe reporter present, that the details they had heard in relation to the\nallegation of masturbation should be disregarded.5.\nThe newspaper said that the prosecutor had read a victim impact statement in\nopen court which referred to the complainant masturbating. It said that there\nwas no order made directing its reporter not to report details of the victim\nimpact statement. It said that after the prosecution had read the victim impact\nstatement, the prosecutor said in open court that it had been decided, in order\nto save time and money, not to hold a Newton hearing to determine whether the\ncomplainant had been masturbating. It claimed that as a Newton hearing is a\nrarely used court process, its reporter did not fully understand its\nimplication. It said that when the magistrates left the room to consider the\ncomplainant’s sentence, the reporter was advised by the court’s legal advisor\nto ensure that the complainant’s denial about masturbating was included in the\narticle, which it was.6.\nThe newspaper provided the reporter’s notes from the hearing which included the\nadvice given to the reporter by the legal advisor. The notes showed that the\nreporter had been told that the complainant had pleaded guilty to outraging\npublic decency because he was naked in his car, and had denied masturbating in\npublic. The legal advisor also advised that the complainant was being sentenced\non that basis.7.\nThe newspaper said that when the complainant called its news desk on 10\nSeptember, it agreed as a gesture of goodwill to carry a clarification under\nthe heading “Court case clarification” on page 6 of the following week’s\nnewspaper which said:An\narticle in last week’s Extra reported that Martin Clark, 44, of Ramsgate, had\npleaded guilty to outraging public decency and drink driving after he was found\nnaked in his car in Whitstable High Street. A witness who reported Clark to the\npolice alleged that he was pleasuring himself, something which he strongly\ndenied. His account, namely that he was not pleasuring himself, was accepted by\nthe prosecution and was sentenced by magistrates on that basis. The Extra is happy\nto clarify this point.8.\nThe newspaper said the publication of the clarification on page 6, in a\nnewspaper with a small news section, constituted due prominence in accordance\nwith Clause 1(ii) of the Code. It said it also published an article online on\n14 September – after the complainant had made contact – which reflected the\ncomplainant’s version of events; it denied that the online article had ever\nreported that the complainant was accused of masturbating.9.\nThe complainant said that online article had been re-written to omit the\nmasturbation allegation after he contacted the newspaper.Relevant\nCode Provisions10.\nClause 1 (Accuracy)i)\nThe Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation, including pictures.ii)\nA significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion once recognised\nmust be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and - where appropriate -\nan apology published. In cases involving the Regulator, prominence should be\nagreed with the Regulator in advance.Findings\nof the Committee11.\nIn the absence of any reporting restrictions at the sentencing hearing, the\nnewspaper was entitled to report what had been said in open court; this\nremained the case even though a portion of the victim impact statement had been\nread in error.12.\nThe reporter’s notes, however, showed that the court’s legal advisor had\nexplained that the complainant had pleaded guilty to outraging public decency\non the basis that he was naked in public, not because he had been masturbating;\nthe legal advisor made clear that he was being sentenced by the magistrates on\nthat basis. This information was not reported in the article, which created the\nmisleading impression that the complainant had been prosecuted and convicted in\nrelation to the allegation of masturbation. This was significantly misleading:\nit was a more serious offence than those to which he pleaded guilty, and the\nreporting of it ignored the prosecution’s acceptance that this allegation\nshould not form part of the case against him. Given that the reporter’s notes\ncontained a clear note of the correct position as explained by the legal\nadvisor, this represented a failure to take care not to publish inaccurate and\nmisleading information in breach of Clause 1(i), and the omission was\nsignificantly misleading so as to require correction under Clause 1(ii).13.\nThe Committee welcomed the newspaper’s prompt publication of a clarification\nwhich made clear that the complainant’s account had been accepted by the\nprosecution. While the wording of this clarification was sufficient to avoid a\nbreach of Clause 1(ii), the Code states that a significant inaccuracy must also\nbe corrected with “due prominence”; generally this will mean the same page or\nfurther forward than the page where the article originally appeared. The article\nhad been published on page 3, while the clarification appeared on page 6. The\nprominence of the correction was not sufficient, and the requirements of 1(ii)\nhad not been met.14.\nThe newspaper had provided evidence that the online article was published on 14\nSeptember, which was after the complainant had made contact with the newspaper;\nthe Committee was satisfied that it did not include reference to masturbation.Conclusions15.\nThe complaint was upheld.Remedial\nAction Required16.\nThe Committee accepted that the original clarification had been published\npromptly and in good faith, and the wording of the clarification recognised the\ninaccuracy. As such, it was satisfied that re-publication of the correction in\nan appropriate location would represent a sufficient remedy.17.\nThe newspaper was required to re-publish the correction either on page 3, where\nthe article was originally published, or further forward in the newspaper. The\ncorrection should additionally state that it had been re-published following a\nruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation. The full wording should\nbe agreed with IPSO in advance.Date\ncomplaint received: 05/11/2015Date\ndecision issued: 03/03/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
