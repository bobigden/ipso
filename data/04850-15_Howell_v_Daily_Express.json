Philip Howell complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Daily Express had breached Clause 3 (Privacy)\nand Clause 9 (Reporting of Crime) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Police haul ‘abusive Brits off Ibiza flight for drunkenly\nabusing cabin crew’”, published online on 18 July 2015. \n2. The article reported that a group of holidaymakers had\nbeen escorted from a flight for allegedly abusing cabin crew who had told them\nthat they would be limited to one alcoholic drink each during the flight. The\narticle included a photograph, which showed the complainant, the captain of the\naircraft, watching police as they dealt with the incident on board. \n3. The complainant said the publication of his image\ncould result in him being targeted by the accused men. Furthermore, he did not\nwant to be associated with any potential prosecution that might be brought by\nthe airline or the Civil Aviation Authority. He said his image had nothing to\ndo with the story and had added nothing to it. He had been acting solely in his\nprofessional role and had been legally required to maintain order on the\naircraft. He asked for his image to be pixelated. \n4. The newspaper considered that a passenger on the\nflight may have had a reasonable expectation of privacy; however, it did not\nconsider that the aircraft’s captain could claim such a right. It said the\ncomplainant was shown acting as the captain, exercising his decision to have a\ngroup of passengers removed. It further considered that the complainant could\nnot have had any expectation of privacy once the police had entered the\naircraft. \n5. The newspaper said the complainant was not named in\nthe article, and the image was not captioned as showing the captain of the\naircraft. It did not consider that the article had revealed any private\ninformation about the complainant, and it declined his request to pixelate his\nimage. \n6. The newspaper said the image showed the events\nunfolding on the aeroplane. It did not consider that Clause 9 had been\nbreached. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 3 (Privacy) \ni.) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her\nprivate and family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. \nii.) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into\nany individual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information. \niii.) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals in\nprivate places without their consent. Note - Private places are public or\nprivate property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. \nClause 9 (Reporting of crime) \ni.) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused\nof crime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they\nare genuinely relevant to the story. \nii.) Particular regard should be paid to the potentially\nvulnerable position of children who witness, or are victims of, crime. This\nshould not restrict the right to report legal proceedings. \nFindings of the Committee\n8. The image had not shown the complainant doing anything\nprivate. It had shown him standing in the main cabin of the aircraft, in clear\nview of passengers and crew, as he carried out his professional duties as\ncaptain. He did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in such\ncircumstances. As the image had not disclosed any private information about the\ncomplainant, the complaint under Clause 3 was not upheld. \n9. Clause 9 is intended to protect friends or relatives\nof individuals accused or convicted of crime, or children who witness or are\nvictims of crime from identification in the press. The complaint did not engage\nthe terms of this Clause. \nConclusions\nThe complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 03/08/2015\nDate decision issued:\n26/10/2015\n\n\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
