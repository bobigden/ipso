    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision of the Complaints Committee 01538-18 Nash v The National1. Pamela Nash\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The National\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in the following\narticles:•“Scotland in\nUnion in crisis after donor details are leaked,” published on 3 January 2018.\n• “Scotland in\nUnion face questions as we reveal foreign billionaire’s donation,” 6 January\n2018.\n• “Scotland in\nUnion accused of trying to bully Electoral Commission over big money donors,”\npublished on 5 February 2018.\n2. The articles\nreported on the content of documents belonging to the organisation, Scotland In\nUnion (SIU), which SIU considered to be confidential and which it said had been\nleaked to the newspaper and to a number of other media outlets. The articles\nreported that the documents had been sent from an anonymous e-mail account to\nvarious publications, and that they contained the names and contact details of\ndonors, as well as details of donations which SIU had allegedly received.\n3. The first\narticle reported that SIU had informed the police and the Information\nCommissioner’s Office (ICO) about the leak, and that the ICO has the power to\nissue fines of up to £500,000. It also included a quotation, given to another\npublication, by a spokesperson from SIU, “All the information on our supporters\nis protected and held securely in accordance with best practice and we regret\ninternal documents have been shared with external parties. We have reported the\nmatter to the police and the Information Commissioner. We have taken all\nnecessary steps to make our affected supporters aware and will continue to\ninvestigate how these documents have been misused.”\n4. The second\narticle reported that SIU was “in crisis as angry supporters ask how they\nmanaged to let a spreadsheet…be stolen and leaked to the press.” It reported\nthat, according to one of the leaked documents, 12 donations of more than £7500\nhad been made to SUI in the run-up to two General Elections and a Scottish\nParliamentary Election. The article noted that this was during the “regulated\nperiod”, when donations are supposed to be declared to the Electoral\nCommission.  The article included a\nstatement from the Electoral Commission, which said, “We consider and assess\npossible breaches of the rules consistent with our published Enforcement Policy\nand we are reviewing the matter” and a statement from SIU, “We are confident\nthat our donations are in accordance with Electoral Commission guidelines and\nwe are awaiting clarification of that.” The article also set out the SIU’s\nposition that none of the donations received were specifically for spending in\nrelation to the General Election campaign and therefore they had been advised\nthat they did not need to declare them.\n5. The third\narticle reported that the Electoral Commission had recently investigated SIU\nfor allegedly not declaring a spending return, but that the Commission had\ndecided not to take this matter further. It also repeated the claim from the\nsecond article, that 12 donations of more than £7,500 had been received by SIU\nduring the “regulated period”. The article said \nthat there appeared to be a “grey area” in the Electoral Commission’s\nrules, as donations not received specifically for regulated campaign spending\ndo not have to be declared and made clear that \nSIU argued that these donations were not donated for the purpose of\nregulated campaign spending.\n6. The complainant\nwas the Chief Executive of SIU. She believed that the information published had\ncome from an incomplete note which had been unlawfully taken from the\norganisation, and therefore should not have been reported. She said that SIU\nhad not seen the documents which had been sent to the newspaper, but based on\nimages posted on another website, she believed that the document was not a\nrecord of donations but a newsletter mailing list, and that, therefore, the\ninformation about the donations reported in the articles was not accurate.\n7. The complainant\nalso said that the articles suggested that SIU had broken the Electoral\nCommission’s rules on receiving and declaring donations and that SIU was being\ninvestigated by the ICO, and could potentially be fined. In fact, this was not\nthe position, as the Electoral Commission had later concluded that all relevant\ndonations had been declared and the SUI was not subject to an investigation by\nthe ICO. She also said it was inaccurate for the second article to claim that\nsupporters were angry and concerned about the leak.\n8. The newspaper\ndid not accept that it had breached the Editors’ Code. It said that it had\naccurately reported the documents which had been leaked to the newspaper, and\nhad made clear that all the claims regarding the details of donations had come\nfrom these documents. It said that when its sister publication and one of its\nown journalists contacted SIU for comment, the spokesperson had accepted that\nan internal document had been unlawfully removed from the organisation and that\nthe police were investigating the theft. In these circumstances, the newspaper said\nit was confident that the documents received were genuine.\n9. It also said\nthat, at the time of publication, the Electoral Commission had confirmed that\nit was reviewing donations received by SIU, as it was not yet clear whether\nthey were in line with the guidelines. The newspaper said that it did, however,\ninclude a statement from SIU, stating that it was confident all its donations\nwere in line with the guidelines. The Electoral Commission later confirmed that\nno further action would be taken in relation to the matter, as the donations\nwere not received for the specific purpose of regulated campaigning. The\nnewspaper said it had reported this in a subsequent article.\n10.  The newspaper\nalso said that its articles did not state that the ICO was investigating the\nalleged leaking of the information; it said that after a data breach such as\nthis, it was natural to ask whether the organisation had the necessary measures\nin place to protect donors’ personal information, as required by the ICO. It\nalso said that where the leaked documents revealed donors’ names, phone numbers\nand other personal information, it was reasonable to claim that supporters were\nlikely to be angry and concerned. It also said a source with close ties to the\norganisation had confirmed that donors were unhappy.\nRelevant Code provisions\n11.  Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and – where\nappropriate – an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nFindings of the Committee\n12. The Committee acknowledged the complainant’s wider\nconcerns regarding the potentially unlawful removal of confidential internal\ndocuments.However, the question for the\nCommittee to consider was whether the newspaper, when reporting on the\ninformation contained in the leaked documents, had done so accurately and in\nline with its obligations under the Editors’ Code.\n13. The newspaper had received a copy of the documents which\nappeared to provide information about SIU’s donors and the amounts they had\ndonated. Prior to publication, SIU had also given a statement to a sister publication,\nconfirming that a document had been misused and stating that the police were\ninvestigating the matter, and that the ICO had been informed.  In these circumstances, the newspaper had\ntaken care in reporting information from the documents on the basis that they\nappeared to be genuine, and there was no breach of Clause 1 (i). The articles\nhad made clear that the claims regarding the amount of donations received by\nSIU had been taken from the leaked spreadsheets, and there was no basis to find\nthat the information contained in the documents had been reported inaccurately.\nReporting the information contained in the documents did not breach Clause 1\n(ii).\n14. The articles had not stated that the Electoral\nCommission had found SIU to be in breach of its guidelines, but reported that\nthe documents suggested that the organisation had received donations of more\nthan £7,500 during the regulated spending period, and that this was being\ninvestigated by the Electoral Commission. At the time of publication, the\nElectoral Commission had confirmed that it was reviewing the matter, and its\nstatement was included in the article. The article also included a statement\nfrom the organisation, expressing its view that all donations had been declared\nas required by the Electoral Commission’s guidelines. In these circumstances,\nthe newspaper had taken care over the accuracy of the claim that the documents\nindicated that donations of over £7,500 had been received during the\n“regulatory period” and that this was being investigated by the Commission. The\narticle had accurately reported that the Commission’s investigation was, at the\ntime, ongoing, and did not state or imply that it had found that SIU had broken\nthe guidelines, as the complainant complained. There was no breach of Clause 1\non this point.\n15. The newspaper had not reported that SIU was being\ninvestigated by the ICO in relation to the matter. Rather, it speculated that\nin circumstances such as this, where donors’ personal data had allegedly been\nshared with third parties, that the ICO may investigate, and noted the level of\nfines which the organisation was able to impose. The newspaper had taken care\nto clearly present this speculation as comment, and had not given the\nmisleading impression that an ICO investigation was being undertaken. There was\nno breach of Clause 1 on this point. Also, as a number of donors’ personal\ninformation had potentially been shared without their consent, and a source\nclose to the organisation had confirmed that this had caused anger and concern\namong donors, the reporting of donors’ reactions did not amount to a breach of\nClause 1 on this point.\nConclusion\n16.  The complaint was\nnot upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n17. N/AReviewThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer\nabout the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent\nComplaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold\nthe request for review.  Date complaint received: 12/02/2018Date decision issued: 19/07/2018 \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
