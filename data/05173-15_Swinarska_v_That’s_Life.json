Marta Swinarska complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that That’s Life! had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy),\nClause 2 (Opportunity to reply), Clause 3 (Privacy), Clause 4 (Harassment),\nClause 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock), and Clause 6 (Children) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Snatched”, published on 21\nAugust 2015.2. The article was a first-person account of a dispute given\nby the complainant’s former partner over the custody of their two children. The\narticle stated that the complainant had taken one of their daughters from their\nhome in Cyprus to Poland, and had refused to return her despite two court\norders stating that the child should live with her father. Her former partner\ndescribed how he finally located the complainant and their daughter in Poland,\nand took the child back to Cyprus. The article stated that the complainant had\npleaded guilty in a Cypriot court to child abduction, and received an 18-month\nsuspended sentence.3. The complainant said that the published account was\ninaccurate, and noted that the court cases were ongoing. She said she had pleaded\nguilty to child abduction in Cyprus in April 2015 because she needed to return\nto her job in Poland; she was not guilty. She considered that the magazine had\nfailed to report her account of the dispute: she provided a statement that she\nhad given to the Cypriot family court, in which she had raised concerns about\nher former partner’s parenting, and had made serious allegations about his\nconduct. She said the children had been “snatched” from her, not from him. The\ncomplainant said that a previous newspaper article, upon which the magazine had\nbased its piece, had also given a misleading account of the events leading up\nto her daughter’s removal from Poland to Cyprus. 4. The complainant said she had not been contacted before\nthe article was published in breach of Clause 2, and she had not agreed to have\nher or her children’s photographs published in breach of Clause 3 and Clause 6.\nShe said the article represented harassment in breach of Clause 4, and an\nintrusion into her and her family’s grief in breach of Clause 5.5. The magazine said that a newspaper had supplied the\nstory, which had also featured on a television programme. Before publishing the\nstory, the magazine said it had interviewed the complainant’s former partner at\nlength. It had not contacted the complainant for her comment because it did not\nhave her contact details. It noted that it had not published the complainant’s\ncomments, which were included in the previous newspaper coverage, but at that\ntime it understood that she had not raised any concerns about the accuracy of\nthat article, and it similarly considered that its piece had been accurate.6. The magazine said the complainant’s former partner had\ndisputed her allegations of misconduct. It considered that had those allegations\nbeen accepted in court, he would not have been awarded custody of the children.7. It noted that the complainant did not dispute that a\ncourt in Poland had ordered the complainant to return her daughter to her\nfather. Furthermore, it said it had seen a copy of the order from the Cypriot\nfamily court, dated 18 May 2015, which awarded custody to the father, pending\nthe trial. During IPSO’s investigation, the magazine provided translations of\nPolish court documents, dated 12 October 2012, which stated that on 25\nSeptember 2012 the court had ordered the compulsory removal of the child from\nthe complainant, but the complainant had not complied with the order.8. The magazine considered that it had been entitled to rely\non the fact of the complainant’s conviction, despite her contention that she\nwas not guilty. As it believed that the article was accurate, it said that an\nopportunity to reply was not required, but it offered to publish a letter from\nthe complainant on its letters page as a potential means to resolve the matter.9. The magazine said that the children’s father had provided\nthe photographs of the children and had given his consent to their publication;\nit did not consider that it had needed the complainant’s consent to publish her\nphotograph. It did not believe that the article represented harassment or an\nintrusion into the complainant’s grief.10. On receipt of the court documents provided by the\nmagazine, the complainant provided further court documents in Polish, which she\nsaid demonstrated that the previous court order had been revoked. These\ndocuments related to a court decision made on 26 August 2013.Relevant Code Provisions11. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i.

It was not in dispute that the complainant had taken her\nchild from Cyprus to Poland, and had failed to comply with two court orders, which\nstated that the child should be returned to her father. It was also accepted\nthat her former partner had taken steps to locate the child and had taken her\nback into his custody, and that the complainant had pleaded guilty to child\nabduction in a court in Cyprus. These details, which the magazine had\naccurately reported, were supported by the court documents supplied by the\nmagazine during IPSO’s investigation.13. In circumstances in which the central aspects of the\nstory had been reported accurately, the omission of the complainant’s version\nof those events was not significantly misleading. The Committee was satisfied\nthat there was no failure to take care over the accuracy of the article. No\nsignificant inaccuracies were identified by the complaint. The complaint under\nClause 1 was not upheld.14. Clause 2 provides for an opportunity to reply to\ninaccuracies, post-publication. The magazine was not obliged to contact the\ncomplainant for her comment before the article was published. Furthermore, in\nresponse to the complaint, the magazine had offered to publish a letter from\nthe complainant on its letters page. There was no breach of Clause 2.15. The magazine had published images of the complainant,\nwhich showed her face, and which had been supplied by her former partner. It\nhad not disclosed any private information in breach of Clause 3.16. While the complainant considered that her former\npartner’s account was inaccurate, its publication did not represent harassment\nor an intrusion into her grief under the terms of the Code. There was no breach\nof Clause 4 or Clause 5.17. The children’s father had supplied images of the\nchildren, and had agreed to their publication. There was no breach of Clause 6.Conclusions18. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial Action RequiredN/A\nDate complaint received: 22/08/2015\nDate decision issued: 11/01/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
