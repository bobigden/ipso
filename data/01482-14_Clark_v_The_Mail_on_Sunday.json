Ms Faith Clark complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation on behalf of Hearing Dogs for Deaf People that The Mail\non Sunday had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in\nan article headlined “The disabled make good staff - unlike baldies with beer\nbellies”, published on 19 October 2014. \n2. The columnist had written a piece about the value of\ndisabled people in the work place, in which she said she had four “hearing\ndogs”. \n3. The complainant was concerned that the coverage gave the\ninaccurate impression that the columnist has four specially trained assistance\ndogs. She said that Hearing Dogs for Deaf People have a programme of careful\nbreading, selection and training. The charity focuses on matching one dog - not\nmultiple dogs - to each deaf partner. The implication that the charity would\nsupply four dogs to one owner was damaging as it suggested that charity was\nwasting resources. The complainant also made clear that the dogs are not\ntrained to cause a commotion, but to convey information by touch. \n4. The complainant said that the newspaper and the columnist\nhad been contacted by the charity in 2013 to request that she refrain from\ndescribing her dogs as “hearing dogs”. \n5. The newspaper explained that that the columnist’s dogs\nhad been trained by a canine behaviour expert to alert her to certain sounds. \n6. It said that the Equality Act makes it illegal to\ndiscriminate against disabled people and this is construed to mean that\ndisabled people must not be excluded from public places because they need to be\naccompanied by a dog. The Act does not define any particular terminology or\nqualifications for hearing dogs. The term “hearing dog” can be used as a\ngeneric description of a dog that helps people with hearing difficulties; it is\ncomparable with “sheepdog, guard dog or gun dog”. \n7. It said that any reader who was interested in the\nprovision of assistance dogs would have known that the charity would not have\nprovided anyone with four dogs of their highly trained dogs. The article did\nnot state that the dogs had been provided by a charity. \n8. The newspaper had also published two readers’ letters\nabout this matter, and the columnist had referenced the concerns in a\nsubsequent piece. It did not accept that the coverage represented a breach of\nthe Code. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n9. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading\nor distorted information, including pictures.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published.\niii) The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nFindings of the Committee\n10. The article had made no reference to the charity or\nindeed suggested any involvement by any charity. The complainant was concerned\nthat it was inaccurate to describe the complainant’s dogs as “hearing dogs” as\nthey had not been provided by the charity. The Committee found that, in\ncircumstances in which the columnist had had her dogs specially trained to\nassist in situations in which she might have difficulties because of her\nhearing, it had not been inaccurate or significantly misleading to describe her\ndogs as “hearing dogs”. The use of the term “hearing dogs” had not given the\nmisleading impression that the dogs had been connected to, or supplied by, the\ncharity. There was no breach of the Code. \n11. While the Committee welcomed the steps taken by the\nnewspaper to address the concerns of the complainant as a positive response to\nthe complaint, it was disappointed that the newspaper had published the\ncolumnist’s rebuttal of the concerns raised while the complaint was on-going. \nConclusions\n12. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A\n \nDate complaint received: 27/10/2014\nDate decision issued: 29/12/2014\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
