Dean Purcell\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that metro.co.uk\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Violent thug who beat up ex-girlfriend must tell police if he starts\nseeing someone new”, published on 15 April 2018.\n2. The article\nreported that the complainant had been issued with a Criminal Behaviour Order,\nwhich ordered that for the next seven years he must, within 72 hours of the\nthird time he has any sexual activity with a woman, give police her details so\nthey can speak to her. It said that in March 2018 the complainant had received\na custodial sentence after he had pleaded guilty to ABH and two counts of\nassault by beating against his former girlfriend. It also reported that\n“charges of false imprisonment, threats to kill, and a count of battery were\nleft to lie on file”.3. The article\nreported a version of events which had apparently led up to the complainant’s\nconviction. It said that the complainant and his victim “had resumed their\nrelationship after breaking-up last July”; it claimed that the complainant\nstarted to assault the victim shortly after they had moved in together. The\narticle reported that the complainant’s victim “felt unable to leave because of\nPurcell’s behaviour and her previous bad experiences with him, which included\nslapping her, biting her ear and threatening to kill her and himself”. It said,\n“when a benefits officer visited their flat, [the victim] was too afraid to say\nwhat had happened but asked if she could take a bath to stay out the way”. It\nsaid that the victim “climbed out the bathroom window in her dressing gown, ran\nto their local shop and asked someone to call the police”.\n4. The complainant\nsaid that the article had created an inaccurate and misleading impression of\nthe conduct to which he had pleaded guilty. He said that the article had\npresented the allegations which the victim had made against him, as though they\nhad been accepted by him as the basis for his guilty plea.\n5. The complainant\nsaid that the article had been based on an inaccurate police press release. He\nsaid that this press release had presented the allegations made against him as\nhaving been established by the court as fact; he said that only the facts which\nhe had accepted as part of his basis of plea, and which had been referred to in\nhis plea hearing, should have been reported on. The complainant said that he\nhad submitted an official complaint to the police regarding its press release.\n6. The complainant\nsaid that he had pleaded guilty to one ABH charge on the basis of excessive\nself-defence. The complainant provided a copy of his basis of plea to IPSO.\nThis document recorded that the conduct relating to this charge was as follows:\n“The defendant felt it necessary to restrain the complainant. This involved\nholding her on the bed with his body weight and holding his hand over her mouth\nin an apparent attempt to prevent her making noise”.\n7. During the\ncourse of IPSO’s investigation, the complainant received the outcome of his complaint\nabout the police press release. The police confirmed that its press release\n“contained information that had been alleged by the victim, but not accepted by\nthe defendant as a basis for his plea of guilty. His plea was on the basis of\nexcessive self-defence which was accepted by the prosecution”.\n8. The complainant\nalso provided a transcript of his plea hearing. This recorded that the two\ncounts of assault related to an incident where the victim’s hair was pulled,\nand one incident where the victim had received “a punch to the leg while they\nwere in [the complainant’s] car”.\n9. The publication\nsaid that the article had been based on a press release originally published\nand disseminated by the Metropolitan Police. The publication said that, given\nthe fact that the complainant had been convicted and sentenced, and that the statement\nhad been put out by the police, it had no reason to doubt the accuracy of what\nwas contained within the statement. The publication said that the police were a\nregular and reliable source of information for the media, and there would not\nnormally be any reason to question the accuracy of their information.\n10. The publication denied that the article contained any\nsignificant inaccuracies. It said that whether or not the victim’s\nrecollections of her previous experiences were heard in court, or were\ncommunicated to the police outside of the judicial process, it was accepted\nthat the statements in the article were her testimony according to the original\npolice statement. Nevertheless, the publication offered to make amendments to\nthe article to clarify that, while some of the victim’s testimony was heard in\ncourt, these allegations were denied by the complainant and did not form a\nsubsequent part of his basis of plea.\n11. The publication also offered to publish the following\nfootnote:\nA previous version of this article carried claims about Mr\nPurcell’s previous behaviour toward his ex-girlfriend which had been included\nby the Metropolitan Police in a media briefing, and which were reported in good\nfaith. We have since been made aware that these allegations are denied by Mr\nPurcell, and the article has been amended to remove certain claims which he\nstates were not heard in open court. Furthermore, we are happy to make clear\nthat his guilty plea to the charge of actual bodily harm was made on the basis\nof excessive self-defence.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n12. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n13. It was not a failure to take care over the accuracy of\nthe article, to rely on the contents of a police press release which had been\nissued following the complainant’s conviction. The publication was entitled to\nrely on the accuracy of the information from this official source. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1 (i).\n14. The article reported that the complainant had “slapped”\nhis victim, “bitten” her ear and threatened to kill her and himself. This was\nthe only reference to the complainant’s conduct against his victim.\n15. The Committee noted that these claims were allegations\nwhich were heard in court, but which had not been accepted by the complainant\nas part of his guilty plea. In addition, the article had made clear that the\ncharge of threats to kill had been left to lie on file; this clearly\ndistinguished it from the charges to which the complainant pleaded guilty.\nFurthermore, in respect of the remaining conduct set out in the article, the\nCommittee did not establish that there was a significant distinction between\nthis conduct and the conduct which the complainant had accepted as part of his\nplea. The remaining information contained in the article was distinguished as\nthe victim’s own account of her relationship with the complainant, which had\nformed part of her evidence against him. The article did not detail further\nallegations of criminal conduct such as would suggest that it would form the\nbasis of the complainant’s conviction. Taking into consideration the factors\nreferred to above, the Committee did not conclude that the article had given a\nsignificantly misleading impression of the nature and extent of the conduct\nwhich had formed the basis for the complainant’s conviction. There was no\nbreach of the Code.\nConclusions\n14. The complaint was not upheld.\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer\nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
