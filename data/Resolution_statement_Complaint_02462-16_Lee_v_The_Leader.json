She\nexpressed concern that she had not been informed in advance that he would not\nbe named for legal reasons. She also considered that the newspaper had\ninaccurately reported the cost of the building work, and that she had taken out\nloans to pay for it.\n4. The newspaper\nsaid that it was sorry if the complainant had been given the impression that\nthe builder would be named in the article; this had never been its intention.\nIt also considered that the article had accurately reflected the information\nthe complainant had given to the reporter, and it provided the notes taken\nduring the conversation.\nRelevant Code provisions\n5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published.
