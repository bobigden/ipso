The article\nwas promoted online with the headline “Katie Hopkins banned from leaving South\nAfrica after taking ketamine”. 3.    The complainant\nsaid that the headline used to promote the article online was inaccurate: she\nhad not been banned from leaving South Africa because she had taken ketamine.\nIn fact, she had been stopped from leaving the country for spreading racial\nhatred. The inaccuracy was significant because it suggested that she had been\nstopped by the authorities for taking a drug which is often misused for illegal\npurposes in the UK. She noted that the article to which the headline linked\nstated the correct position; however, she considered that most people would not\nhave clicked through to that article, and would have been left with a\nsignificantly misleading impression of the reasons for her detention. 4.    The\nnewspaper did not consider that the headline used to promote the article online\nrepresented a significant inaccuracy. It said that the temporary ban\nhad been imposed after the complainant had taken ketamine, and the main article\nheadline and content had clearly reported this. 5.    In\nlight of the concerns raised, however, the newspaper amended the headline to\nread “Katie Hopkins banned from leaving South Africa for ‘spreading racial\nhatred’, and it added the following subheading beneath the headline to the\nactual article: A\nprevious version of this article suggested that Katie Hopkins was stopped from\nleaving South Africa because of the consumption of Ketamine. We are happy to\nclarify that Ms Hopkins was detained for spreading racial hatred, which took\nplace after the Ketamine incident. 6.    The\ncomplainant did not accept the amendments as a resolution to her complaint. She\nconsidered that it would not correct the misleading impression given to the\nmillions of people who had been misinformed by the original headline. \nRelevant Code provisions 7.   \nClause\n1 (Accuracy) i) The Press must take care not\nto publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including\nheadlines not supported by the text. ii) A significant inaccuracy,\nmisleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due\nprominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In cases involving\nIPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator. iii) A fair opportunity to reply\nto significant inaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for. \nFindings of the Committee 8.   \nThe\ncomplainant had been detained in South Africa for spreading racial hatred, not\nfor taking ketamine. The Committee did not accept that the word “after” in the promotional\nheadline made clear that it was referring to the chronology of events, rather\nthan to causality. While the article itself stated the correct position, the promotional\nheadline had given the significantly misleading impression that the reason for\nthe detention had been the consumption of ketamine. This headline was not\nsupported by the text. This represented a failure to take care over the\naccuracy of the article in breach of Clause 1(i). 9.   \nOn\nreceipt of the complaint, the newspaper had amended the inaccurate headline so\nthat it made clear that the complainant had been detained for spreading racial\nhatred. During IPSO’s investigation, it also published a corrective note at the\ntop of the article itself, which identified the inaccuracy and made clear the\nreasons for the complainant’s detention. \nThis was sufficient to meet the terms of Clause 1(ii). \nConclusion 10. The complaint was upheld. \nRemedial action 11. Having upheld the complaint, the\nCommittee considered what remedial action should be required. 12. The newspaper had corrected the\ninaccuracy and had published a corrective note at the top of the article, which\nmade clear the true position regarding the complainant’s detention in South\nAfrica. No further action was required. \nReview\nThe\npublication complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process\nfollowed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent Complaints\nReviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold the request\nfor review.  \nDate\ncomplaint received: 07/02/2018\nDate\ndecision issued: 02/05/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
