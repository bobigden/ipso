A man complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The Scottish\nSun breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “BA 'RACE TWEET' STORM”, and that The Sun breached Clause 1\n(Accuracy) in an article headlined “BA race slur fury”, both of which were\npublished on 1 November 2018.2. The articles\nreported on an allegedly “racist tweet” the complainant had posted. The print\narticles reported that the complainant, a member of cabin crew, was being\ninvestigated by his employer after he posted an allegedly racist tweet about a\nwoman wearing a sari, prior to a flight to Denver. The article quoted reactions\nfrom members of the public who expressed disgust at the complainant and his\nremark, and said that Indian female staff were deeply offended by the\nbehaviour, speculating that the tweet was aimed at a colleague. The article\nalso noted that the complainant had an active social media presence and had\nposted a photograph of himself on social media wearing a pilot’s headset in the\ncockpit of a plane, which it said may be a breach of airline regulations.3. The Scottish Sun\narticle also appeared online with the headline “BA RACE ROW British Airways\n‘race’ storm as Scottish manager accused of public slur comparing Asian woman’s\nprivate parts to ‘festering kimchi’”.4. The complainant\nsaid that neither he nor the tweet were racist. He claimed that the woman\nwearing the sari was not Asian, Indian or a colleague. He said that, in fact,\nthe woman may not have been wearing a sari at all, and the garment may instead\nhave been a “highly decorated skirt”.5. He also said\nthat the comment was made on Instagram, not Twitter, and it was not posted\nahead of a flight to Denver. He said that at the time of publication, there was\nno investigation into his behaviour by his employers. Furthermore, he said that\nthe photographs of him at work did not breach any airline regulations.6. The publication\nsaid that it was not in dispute that the complainant had made the comment on\nsocial media, and many people had considered it to be racist, even if the\ncomplainant claimed that this was not his intention; a number of colleagues had\nraised serious concerns about his language and behaviour. The publication said\nthat saris were clearly and exclusively an Indian garment, which were not\nwidely worn by non-Indian women - it was not inaccurate to state that the tweet\nreferred to an Asian woman. The publication said that the further claims\nregarding the subject of the post - which the publication was entitled to\nreport - were clearly attributed to others and were not adopted by the\npublication as points of fact; however it noted that Indian International Cabin\nCrew staff wear saris.7. The publication\nnoted that he had hash-tagged the post “Denver”, and this was put to the\ncomplainant prior to publication. Nevertheless, it offered to amend the online\narticle to remove the reference to Denver. The publication said that it was the\nreporter’s understanding at the time of publication that the complainant’s\nemployer was about to begin an investigation into the complainant; as this\nsubsequently occurred, the article was not inaccurate on this point.8. The publication\nsaid that according to regulations, crew mobile phones should be switched off\nwhen the crew are in the aircraft. However it said that if the complainant could\npoint to the specific rules regarding the use of phones at certain heights, it\nwould be happy to amend the online article accordingly.9. In addition, the\npublication offered the complainant the opportunity to add a statement to the\nonline version of the article. This was declined.Relevant Code Provisions10. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Mediated outcome11. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.12. During IPSO’s investigation, the publication offered to\nremove the online version of the article.13. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto his satisfaction.14. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 03/11/2018Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 28/01/2019\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
