It reported that police\nand fire crews were investigating the matter. The article was accompanied by\nphotographs taken from outside the property showing the extent of the damage.\nSome of the photographs showed the interior of the house, which had been made\nvisible by the absence of an external wall.  Some furniture and other\nitems were visible including bed clothes, the rear of a book case, a desktop\ncomputer, a bath and a shower. The article was also accompanied by a video taken\nfrom the same vantage points as the photographs, and showing the same\ninformation.\n3.\nThe complainant said that the photographs were taken on her land at the rear of\nthe house, and that no one had approached her about taking them. She said that\nher bedroom, bathroom and stairs were clearly visible in the photographs, and\nthat this aspect of the property had not been visible to members of the\npublic.  She said that the contents of her home are private, and that the\nphotographs were intrusive. She noted that a member of public has commented on\nthe fact that she had no cover on her duvet, and that jokes had been made about\nher bath, which was shown hanging off the side of the building. She said that\nher house was looted, which the police warned her would happen after the\npictures were published.\n4.\nThe publication said that the gas explosion not only affected the complainant,\nbut also her neighbours and the local community. It said that the story was of\nobvious interest to the public; the photographs did not show any private\ninformation about the complainant, but simply recorded the fact that damage had\nbeen caused to the property.\n5.\nThe publication said that the agency photographer had originally taken some\nphotographs from the road, but did not have a good view of the most damaged\npart of the house. After asking around in the area, the photographer spoke to a\nman who identified himself as the complainant’s father, and the owner of the\nproperty. He asked where he could a take a picture of the damage to the house,\nand he was directed to a spot at the rear of the property, which was where the\nphotographs were taken. The publication said that this spot was accessed\nwithout crossing any barriers or cordons, or opening any gates.\n6.\nThe complainant said that her father was unable to recall his conversations\nwith the press, but that he was sure that he did not escort, indicate or show\nanybody to a position where they could take the photographs. The complainant\nsaid that the fire brigade had cordoned off the land on which the photographs\nwere taken with tape.  She said that while the publication had argued that\npublishing the photographs was in the public interest, it had not been\ninterested in what had caused the explosion, nor did she believe the public would\nbe better informed about the importance of gas safety as a result of the\nreporting.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\n7.\nClause 3 (Privacy)\ni)\nEveryone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home,\nhealth and correspondence, including digital communications.\nii)\nEditors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private\nlife without consent. Account will be taken of the complainant's own public\ndisclosures of information.\nThe\nPublic Interest\n 1.\nThe public interest includes, but is not confined to:\n ii)\nProtecting public health and safety\nFindings\nof the Committee\n8.\nThe Committee recognised the difficulty and distress the gas explosion caused\nthe complainant. It appreciated that the publication of the photographs may\nhave caused the complainant additional distress at what was a difficult time.\n9.\nHowever, given the extent of the damage, including the destruction of external\nwalls, the visibility of some of the damage from a public road, the presence of\nemergency services and the fact that the explosion was a significant and\nlegitimate news story, the complainant did not have a reasonable expectation\nthat her property was a private place. The furniture and other items depicted\nin the photographs and video were common household items which did not reveal\nany particular details about the complainant’s private life. Further, the\nphotographs and video only showed what could be seen by standing at the rear of\nthe property; the photographer did not enter the building.  In addition,\nthere was a public interest in illustrating the extent of the damage caused by\nthe gas explosion, which highlighted the importance of gas safety. Because of\nthe extent of the damage, it would not have been possible to do so without\nshowing some of what had previously been the internal contents of the house.\n10.\nOn the publication’s account, the complainant’s father identified himself, and\nexplained where the photographer should stand to get the best picture. The\ncomplainant denied that her father escorted the photographer to this spot or\nindicated where to go, but said that her father could not recollect what he had\nsaid in his conversations to the press. In these circumstances, the Committee\naccepted the account of the conversation provided by the publication.\n11.\nThis gas explosion was the legitimate subject of news coverage, and\nillustrating the extent of the damage was in the public interest. There was no\nfailure to respect the complainant’s privacy, and there was no breach of Clause\n3.\nConclusions\n12.\nThe complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\nN/A\nDate\ncomplaint received: 15/12/2015\nDate decision issued: 02/03/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
