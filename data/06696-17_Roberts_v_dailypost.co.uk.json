Karon Roberts\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the\ndailypost.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause 9\n(Reporting of crime) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined\n“Men who brawled after Euro 2016 match gave Caernarfon a 'bad name'”, published\non 24 April 2017.\n2. The article\nreported on the complainant’s step son’s conviction after he had “drunkenly\nbrawled” after a Euro 2016 football match, along with another named individual.\nThe article contained a 42 second video of the complainant and his stepson,\nwalking into the court building. The article also included a photograph of the\ncomplainant’s stepson, taken as a still from the video footage, as well as a\nphotograph of his co-defendant.\n3. The complainant\nwas not involved in the fight: he said he was not relevant to the story and the\npublication of the video had given the misleading impression that he was one of\nthe defendants, and had intruded into his privacy.\n4. The publication\nsaid that the complainant had appeared with the defendant outside of court\nwhere there was a reasonable expectation that the press, including\nphotographers and videographers, may be present. It also said that the article\nhad contained two large photographs which had identified the two defendants,\nmaking clear that the complainant had not been one of them.\n5. In response to\nthe complaint, the publication published a caption on the video which specified\nthat the defendant was the individual walking on the right-hand side of the\nvideo. It also offered to publish the following clarification on the online\narticle:\nAn earlier version of this article included a video showing\none of the defendants [name] and his stepfather walking towards the court\nwithout a caption. We would like to make clear that the defendant, [name], is\nthe man on the right-hand side of the image and that his stepfather was not\ninvolved in the incident subject to the proceedings at Caernarfon Crown Court.\nRelevant Code provisions\n6. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion\nmust be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate —\nan apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as\nrequired by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\nClause 2 * (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nClause 9* (Reporting of Crime)\ni) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of\ncrime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they are\ngenuinely relevant to the story.\nii) Particular regard should be paid to the potentially\nvulnerable position of children who witness, or are victims of, crime. This\nshould not restrict the right to report legal proceedings.\nFindings of the Committee\n7. The press are\nentitled to report on court proceedings and serve a public interest in\nidentifying those convicted or accused of crime. While the complainant had not\nbeen involved in the incident, he had appeared in a public forum, accompanying\none of the defendants as he had entered a court building: in doing so, the\ncomplainant had become relevant to the story. In the context of an article\nwhich was primarily a report of court proceedings and where the complainant had\nbeen filmed in a public location, entering court in the company of his stepson\nand was not engaged in private activity, the Committee did not conclude that\nthe publication of this video represented a breach of Clause 9 or Clause 2.\n8. The article had\ncontained two photographs which had identified the complainant’s stepson and\nhis co-defendant and both men had been named. In those circumstances, any\nambiguity as to who the defendants were, was remedied in the body of the\narticle and the Committee did not conclude that the article gave the misleading\nimpression that that the complainant had been one of the accused. Nevertheless,\nthe Committee noted the publication’s prompt action of adding the\ncaption to the video, and welcomed its offer of a clarification. There was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusions\n9. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\nN/ADate complaint received: 04/05/2017Date decision issued: 06/09/2017  \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
