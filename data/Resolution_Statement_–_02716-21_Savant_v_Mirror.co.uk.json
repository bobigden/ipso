Adam Savant complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that Mirror.co.uk breached Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or\nshock) and Clause 5 (Reporting of suicide) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in\nan article headlined “Brit holidaymaker found dead in airport was denied flight\nfor 'being too drunk'”, published on 11 March 2021.\n2. The online article reported on the adjournment of inquest\nproceedings following a formal request made by the family of the deceased.\n3. The complainant, acting on behalf of the partner of the\ndeceased, said the article breached Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nand Clause 5 (Reporting of suicide). He said that the level of detail included\nwithin the article was excessive and insensitive, causing considerable distress\nto the family. He said that the inclusion of photographs of the deceased that\nwere obtained from the Facebook profile of the partner, without her consent,\nwas intrusive. He also expressed concern at the approach made by the reporter to\nthe partner for her comments following the inquest. He disputed that the\nreporter had attended the inquest; a point claimed within the message sent by\nthe reporter over Facebook messenger.\n4. The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. Whilst\nit said that it understood the sensitive nature of the material published, it\nsaid that the article was a report of a public inquest; all the details\ncontained in the article had been made public at the inquest, and were reported\nin a factual manner, without sensationalising the issue. It maintained that the\nreporter had attended the inquest in person and was satisfied that their\napproach to the bereaved was handed sensitively.  It noted that reporter had taken notes during\nproceedings and provided a copy of these notes in support of its position in\nregard to this.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock\nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings\nClause 5 (Reporting suicide)\nWhen reporting suicide, to prevent simulative acts care\nshould be taken to avoid excessive detail of the method used, while taking into\naccount the media's right to report legal proceedings.\nMediated Outcome\n5. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n6. During IPSO’s investigation, the publication offered, as\na gesture of goodwill, to remove the online article.  \n7. The complainant said that this would resolve his\ncomplaint.\n8. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 15/03/2021\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 01/06/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
