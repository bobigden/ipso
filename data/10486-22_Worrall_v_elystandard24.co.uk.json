Worrall complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nelystandard24.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy), and\nClause 3 (Harassment) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined\n“Villagers react angrily to 51 extra holiday lodges”, published on 15 April\n2022.\n2. The\narticle, which appeared online only, reported on plans to build holiday lodges\non the grounds of a golf and country club. The article closed with the\nfollowing paragraph: “Nine years ago, the complex became the centre of\ncontroversy after Bespoke Oak Supplies Ltd of Wisbech celebrated completion of\nthe £2m club house. Managing director David Worrall toasted his company’s\ncraftsmanship with champagne but the next day it all went horribly wrong. His\nfirm went bust owing £1.6 million.” The article was accompanied by a photograph\nof the complainant holding a glass of champagne.\n3. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. He said\nthat it was inaccurate to state that “the next day it all went horribly wrong.\nHis firm went bust owing £1.6 million”, both because it was not “his firm” - he\nhad simply, at one time prior to the company entering liquidation, been its\nmanaging director – and because the company had entered liquidation two months\nafter the party celebrating the clubhouse’s opening, when he was no longer\nassociated with the company. He said that the celebration of the clubhouse’s\nopening had taken place on 13 of February 2013; he resigned on 18 February\n2013; and the proposal for the company to be voluntarily “wound up” – which the\ncomplainant said he was unaware of at the time – was made on 23 April 2013. He\nsaid that these alleged inaccuracies constituted an immense threat to his reputation.\nHe also said that the photograph which accompanied the article was in breach of\nClause 1. He said that he had not objected to the photograph being taken in\n2013, but he did object to its use in the context of an article which he\nconsidered to be inaccurate.\n4. The\ncomplainant also said that the article breached Clause 2, as he considered the\narticle to be a personal attack that intruded into his private and family life,\nand that the article’s publication had led to great distress and embarrassment\nto his family. He further said that the article breached the Public Interest\nsection of the Code, and that the terms of Clause 3 had been breached, as he\nconsidered the publication of inaccurate articles constituted persistent\npursuit in breach of this Clause.\n5. The\ncomplainant provided an article, published by the Cambs Times’ sister newspaper\nin June 2013, which reported on the company having gone “bust”. The 2013\narticle said: “[M]anaging director David Worrall drank champagne to toast the\ncompletion of a £2million leisure complex but the next day he quit. […] Within\nweeks, his firm went bust owing £1.6million.”\n6. The\npublication first apologised for any offence caused to the complainant by way\nof his inclusion in the article. It said that having reviewed the editor’s\ninbox, where the original complaint email had been sent, it could not locate\nthe email but nevertheless wanted to deal promptly with the issues raised by\nthe complainant. It offered to: remove all references to the complainant and his\nformer company from the online article, and offer an assurance that the\ninformation would not be republished online or in print; to speak to the\ncomplainant personally to assist in “putting the record straight”; to publish a\nclarification online and print, explaining the circumstances of the company’s\ndissolution and the complainant’s involvement in the company, along with an\napology if it had misunderstood the complainant’s position. The references to\nthe complainant were removed from the article prior to IPSO beginning its\ninvestigation.\n7. The\npublication also proposed to publish the following clarification as a footnote\nto the online article:\nIn a\nrecent article in the Cambs Times and Wisbech Standard reference was made to\nBespoke Oak Supplies Ltd and its managing director David Worrall. The\nphotograph was repeated from an article published in 2013 and the completion by\nBespoke Oak Supplies Ltd of a major construction contract. Mr Worrall says his\nWisbech company did not, as stated, go into liquidation the day after the\nreception to celebrate completion of the contract but did so later. Mr Worrall\nsays at the time of the liquidation of Bespoke Oak Supplies, he was no longer a\nshareholder and not involved with the company's finances at that stage. We are\nhappy to make this clarification.\n8.\nNotwithstanding its apology to the complainant and proposal to publish a\nclarification, the publication said that it did not consider that the article\nwas significantly inaccurate, misleading, or distorted. It said that the\ncomplainant was shown in Companies House documents as being both a director and\nmanaging director of the company.  It\nalso said that Bespoke Oak Supplies had ceased trading and closed its premises\nthe day after the 13th of February party; it did not therefore accept that it\ncould be inaccurate to report that “the next day it all went horribly wrong.\nHis firm went bust owing £1.6 million” when the company had ceased trading\nwhile the complainant was still managing director, and the business had gone\ninto liquidation shortly after his resignation. It considered that it was\nsemantics to argue that summarising these events as the article rendered it\nsignificantly inaccurate, misleading, or distorted in breach of Clause 1.\n9. To\nsupport its position, the publication provided: a copy of the liquidator’s\nreport, which showed that on 23 April 2013 the company’s liabilities totalled\n£1,643,053.44; a form from the publicly accessible Companies House website\nshowing that the complainant ceased being a managing director of the company on\n18 February 2013; and an article which had been published at the time of the\nclubhouse’s opening on 22 February 2013.\n10. The\npublication did not accept that the use of the photograph of the complainant\nrepresented a possible breach of Clause 1. It said that the photograph was\ntaken at the party celebrating the clubhouse’s opening and the complainant had\nconsented to being photographed. It also did not consider the terms of Clause 2\nor Clause 3 to be engaged, and noted that the complainant had spoken openly\nwith the editor of the publication a number of times during previous years –\nfor instance, inviting him to his home and taking lunch with him to discuss\nBespoke Oak Limited.\n11. The\ncomplainant said that the action proposed by the publication was not sufficient\nto address his concerns. He wished for the newspaper to publish a front-page\nretraction, acknowledging that the article was incorrect and apologising to\nhim, his family, and his friends.\n12. The\ncomplainant further said that it was untrue to state that Bespoke Oak Supplies\nhad closed and ceased trading on 14 February 2013, and questioned why the\nnewspaper had published an article about Bespoke Oak Supplies on 22 February\n2013 if it had ceased trading over a week earlier.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished.

An\nexceptional public interest would need to be demonstrated to over-ride the\nnormally paramount interests of children under 16.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n13.\nWhile there was a dispute over the precise date on which Bespoke Oak Supplies\nhad ceased trading, which the Committee was not in a position to resolve, both\nparties accepted that the company had not entered liquidation until two months\nafter the party celebrating the opening of the golf club, and that the\ncomplainant had resigned as managing director prior to this. The article\nreported that the complainant “toasted his company’s craftsmanship with\nchampagne but the next day it all went horribly wrong. His firm went bust owing\n£1.6 million.”\n14. The\nCommittee considered that the publication had not taken care in reporting that\n“Managing Director David Worrall toasted his company’s craftsmanship with\nchampagne but the next day it all went horribly wrong. His firm went bust […]\n“, as this implied that the company had entered liquidation the day after his\nattendance at the  party, and while the\ncomplainant remained Managing Director. \nIn fact, the company went into liquidation two months later in April\n2013, following the complainant’s resignation as a director on 18 February\n2013. Referring to the company as “his” company in the context of reporting on\nthe company’s liquidation was inaccurate, in circumstances where  he was no longer Managing Director at the\ntime the company was liquidated. The newspaper’s own previous reporting made\nclear in  2013  that the timeframe had been longer and that\nthe company “went bust within weeks” of the party. It had also not taken any\nsteps, prior to the publication of the article under complaint,  to confirm the date on which the company\n“went bust”, such as by contacting the complainant, or consulting publicly\navailable records at Companies House. There was therefore a breach of Clause\n1(i).\n15. The\nCommittee considered the inaccuracy to be significant, in circumstances where\nmisreporting the date on which the company entered into liquidation implied\nthat the complainant was still involved with the company at the time of its\nliquidation, when this was not the case – this inaccuracy had the potential to\nimpact on the complainant’s reputation. The newspaper was therefore required to\ncorrect the inaccuracy, in line with the terms of Clause 1 (ii).\n16. The\nCommittee turned next to the question of whether the action taken by the\npublication was sufficient to address the terms of Clause 1 (ii). The\npublication had, in its first communication with the complainant, offered to\npublish a clarification explaining the circumstances of the company’s\ndissolution and the complainant’s involvement in the company, along with an\napology if it had misunderstood the complainant’s position. It had later\nproposed the following wording:\nMr\nWorrall says his Wisbech company did not, as stated, go into liquidation the\nday after the reception to celebrate completion of the contract but did so\nlater. Mr Worrall says at the time of the liquidation of Bespoke Oak Supplies,\nhe was no longer a shareholder and not involved with the company's finances at\nthat stage.\n17. The\nCommittee considered that the newspaper had offered to publish a correction\npromptly – once it became aware of the complainant’s concerns via IPSO – and\nhad proposed to publish it in a sufficiently prominent position: as a footnote\nto the amended online article. However, the wording of the correction only put\nthe complainant’s position on record, rather than putting the correct factual\nposition on record. The Committee further noted that the proposed wording\nreferenced only inaccurate articles in other, sister, publications, rather than\nthe publication under complaint. There was, therefore, a breach of Clause 1\n(ii), where the correction did not make clear that it was a matter of fact that\nthe complainant had resigned before the company had entered liquidation.\n18. The\ncomplainant also considered that the correction should have included an\napology. Notwithstanding that the correction proposed did not put the correct\nposition of fact on record, the Committee did not consider that an apology\nshould be required given: the promptness with which the publication had\nattempted to address the complainant’s concerns during the IPSO process; that\nfact that it had offered to apologise during correspondence with the complainant;\nand the fact that it had apologised directly to the complainant for any offence\ncaused by his inclusion in the article. There was no breach of Clause 1 (ii)\narising from the lack of apology in the proposed remedial action.\n19.  The Committee also considered that the\npublication had demonstrated that it had taken care over the claim that the\ncompany had owed £1.6 million at the time it went “bust”, where the\nliquidators’ report showed liabilities totalling £1,643,053.44. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1 on this point.\n20.\nWhile the complainant did not consent to his photograph being used in the\ncontext of the article under complaint, this did not render its use inaccurate,\nmisleading, or distorted. There was no breach of Clause 1 arising from the\nphotograph’s use.\n21.  The complainant’s previous involvement with\nBespoke Oak Limited was a matter of public record, and reporting on this did\nnot constitute an intrusion into the complainant’s private or family life. The\nCommittee also did not consider that the publication of the article constituted\npersistent pursuit as defined by Clause 3, and noted that persistent pursuit is\ngenerally defined as a journalist following or contacting an individual against\ntheir wishes. There was, therefore, no breach of Clause 2 or Clause 3.\n22.\nWhile the complainant had expressed concerns that the publication of the\narticle was not in the public interest, the Committee noted that it was not\npossible for this portion of the Code to be breached. The Public Interest\nsection of the Code is not a standalone Clause; rather, it allows for\npublication to publish stories and engage in activity which would otherwise\nengage certain Clauses of the Code, provided there is a proportionate public\ninterest.\nConclusion(s)\n23. The\ncomplaint was partly upheld under Clause 1.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n24.\nHaving upheld a breach of Clause 1, the Committee considered what remedial\naction should be required. In circumstances where the Committee establishes a\nbreach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the publication of a correction\nand/or adjudication, the terms and placement of which is determined by IPSO.\n25. In\ncoming to a view on the appropriate remedy in this case, the Committee\nconsidered the seriousness and extent of the breach of the Code. It also noted the\nsteps taken by the newspaper following IPSO investigation, which included the\nremoval of the information under complaint from the online article and the\nproposal of a correction – notwithstanding that the wording of the correction\ndid not address the terms of Clause 1 (ii). The Committee therefore considered\nthat the appropriate remedy was the publication of a correction, putting on\nrecord the correct position regarding the complainant and his former company.\n26.  The Committee then considered the placement\nof the correction. It should appear as a footnote to the online amended\narticle. The wording of this clarification should be agreed with IPSO in\nadvance and should make clear that it had been published following an upheld\nruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation.\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 04/07/2022\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 13/10/2022\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
