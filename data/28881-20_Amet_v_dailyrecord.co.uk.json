Lorene\nAmet complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\ndailyrecord.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause\n10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “High paid doctor falsely claims MMR jab triggers autism”,\npublished on 1 November 2020.\n2. The\narticle reported on an investigation into an autism specialist described as a\n“self-proclaimed” autism expert. The article reported that an investigator “who\nhas two autistic children – posed as worried mum Petra to discuss fictional\nRaye, seven” to have a video consultation with the specialist. It also stated\nthat Raye’s diet included “chicken nuggets, fruit juice and noodles”. It said\nthat the “probe was triggered when a parent raised concerns about the work of\nAmet’s clinic – Autism Treatment Plus – which claims to have improved the\ndevelopment of 80 per cent of its patients”. The article contained a still\nimage of the specialist taken from the video consultation.\n3. The\narticle claimed that the specialist had said that the child’s diet could be\nbehind her “challenging behavioural issues” and that “organic chicken nuggets”\ncould alleviate autism as part of an exclusion diet and that the specialist had\nsent the investigator “vegan” recipes as part of the consultation. It reported\nthat the “National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has discredited [a\nchange in diet] as a way of managing autism in young people.” It also stated\nthat the specialist had suggested that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism,\nand that “doctors ‘do not do their job’ as autism is not reported as an\n‘adverse reaction’ to the MMR jab”, and that studies which linked the two had\nbeen “suppressed”. The article reported that “experts” were horrified by the\nspecialist’s remarks, and contained a quote from a named doctor. The article\nsaid that the investigator had been sent a questionnaire which had the tagline\n“autism is treatable”. The article said that the specialist had recommended\nvarious tests and “anti-inflammatories” for the child and that “further\n‘treatment’ would involve working with medics in Geneva.”\n4. The\ncomplainant was the specialist referred to in the article. She said that the\narticle had breached Clause 10 of the Editors’ Code as the video consultation\nhad been recorded and an image had been taken of her without her knowledge with\na clandestine device. She said that the investigator had engaged in subterfuge\nby inventing a child and by concealing the fact she was working for a newspaper\nin order to arrange the session. The complainant said that the article was not\nin the public interest, as the allegations against her were false and the\narticle was inaccurate. She also said that the investigator had an undisclosed\nconflict of interest as she worked as an activist for a company whose work\nfocused on people with Autism; that she had worked with the press previously\nand had been paid for this work; and she believed the investigator and\njournalist had a bias against her.\n5. The\ncomplainant also said the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. She\nsaid that she had not said that the child’s diet could be behind her\n“challenging behavioural issues”, nor that “organic chicken nuggets” could\nalleviate autism. She said that in fact she had recommended a self-restrictive\ndiet overall, and that chicken nuggets were simply an example of how a food\nthat the specific case had been said to consume previously could be made with\nhealthy ingredients and less inflammatory food in line with this diet. She also\nsaid that it was a contradiction within the article to state she recommended\nboth “chicken nuggets” and “vegan” recipes.\n6. The\ncomplainant also said that it was inaccurate to report that the “National\nInstitute for Health and Care Excellence has discredited [a change in diet] as\na way of managing autism in young people” and that the correct position was\nthat it did not recommend a change of diet “for the management of core features\nof autism in children and young people\". She said that exclusion diets did\nnot aim to address these “core features”, but the physical comorbidities\nassociated with autism. She also referred to a study within the guidelines\nwhich said that six out of nine children and young people had found gluten-free\ndiets to be beneficial, and four out of six had found casein-free diets to be.\nThe complainant referred to a paper written by her company which had found\nexclusionary diets to be helpful. She also said that the guidelines were from\n2013 and may be reviewed in the future, and that NHS guidance is not the most\nrecent information, and that experts may utilise information from more recent\nstudies.\n7. The\ncomplainant also said it was inaccurate to describe her as a “self-proclaimed”\nautism expert as there is no such thing as an “autism expert” as the condition\nis not fully understood, but that she described herself as having “an\nexpertise” in autism on her website as she has various certificates, training,\nand experience within the field of autism.\n8. The\ncomplainant said it was inaccurate to report that the probe was triggered after\na parent raised concerns about the complainant. The complainant said she was\nnot aware of such concerns, nor did she think such a parent would have\ncontacted the publication.\n9. The\ncomplainant said it was misleading for the article to state that her practice\n“claims to have improved the development of 80 per cent of its patients”, as\nher website did not state that 80% of families who come to her seeking advice\nimprove due to the diet change.\n10. The\ncomplainant also said it was inaccurate to report that she had suggested that\nthe MMR vaccine is linked to autism, as she had never said this, and that she\nhad mentioned other possible factors that may have contributed to the child’s\nautism. She also said that it was the investigator who had repeatedly brought\nup the MMR vaccine and asked her whether there was a link. She also said it was\nmisleading to report she had said that “doctors ‘do not do their job’ as autism\nis not reported as an ‘adverse reaction’ to the MMR jab”, and that studies\nwhich linked the two had been “suppressed” as what she actually said was that\nhealth concerns reported by some parents following vaccination are not reported\nby GPs to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency.\n11. The\ncomplainant said it was misleading to report that “experts”, including a quote\nfrom a named doctor, were horrified by the complainant’s remarks. She said that\nfirstly, as she disputed that she had made the comments in the article, it was\ninaccurate to report that experts had disagreed with her. She also said that as\nonly one expert was named it was inaccurate to refer to “experts” in the\nplural.\n12. The\narticle claimed that the investigator was sent a questionnaire with the tagline\n“autism is treatable”. The complainant said she did not send a questionnaire\nwith this tagline. She supplied both the email sent and the questionnaire she\nintended the investigator to answer, which did not have this tagline. The\ninvestigator had also sent the complainant screenshots of the survey she had\ncompleted, which the complainant provided, and which did not contain the\ntagline “autism is treatable”. She accepted that the third-party website that\nthis questionnaire came from used the tagline “autism is treatable” but noted\nthat she did not send a document with this tagline personally.\n13. The\ncomplainant said it was misleading to report that she had recommended various\ntests and “anti-inflammatories”. She said that in fact, after the investigator\nasked what testing was available, she made her aware of such tests in response\nto her request. She said she also made clear there were no benefits to testing,\nand that therefore she could not be described as “recommending” tests. The\ncomplainant also said she did not recommend anti-inflammatories, but a diet\nthat was anti-inflammatory in nature. She said that as she did not recommend\nsuch consultations or tests, it was inaccurate to report that “further\n‘treatment’ would involve working with medics in Geneva.”\n14. The\ncomplainant also said that the article breached Clause 2 (Privacy) as a\nscreenshot of the video consultation showing her face, in her home where she\nworked, was included.\n15. The\npublication did not accept a breach of the Code. It accepted that Clause 10 was\nengaged, but said that there was sufficient public interest to justify the\ninvestigator’s actions. It said that a source made the publication aware of the\ncomplainant's firm and that a further source told it the complainant's firm had\nbeen mentioned to them by concerned parents in the course of their work\ncampaigning for government regulation over unproven Autism treatments. The\npublication then commissioned an investigator it had worked with previously to\npursue the story. The publication said that, prior to engaging in the\nsubterfuge there was a discussion with the editor as to what information would\nbe collected, the means of collecting it, and whether it was in the public\ninterest.\n16. The\npublication stated that no other methods had been used to obtain the\ncomplainant’s views; however, the misrepresentation and subterfuge was\nproportionate, and had to be used in this case in order to see how the\ncomplainant engaged with a potential client, rather than a newspaper. It said\nthat a video consultation was the usual practice in the complainant’s booking\nprocess and therefore it used this method, and it was not aware of a way to\nreceive a similar result with a lower level of subterfuge or a less intrusive\nmethod, or no clandestine device.\n17. The\npublication also stated that the investigation was in the public interest on\nthe grounds that it would help protect public health and safety, and would\nprotect the public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual\nor organisation. The publication also said that previous investigations had\nfound that the complainant did not disclose that her doctorate was not medical.\nIt also stated that if parents are paying or considering paying for the therapy\non the understanding that this is a legitimate 'medical' treatment, then they\nwere potentially being exploited and the general public needed to be made\naware.\n18. With\nregards to the accuracy of the article, the publication provided a transcript\nof the recording, and shortly afterwards the audio recording of the meeting.\nThe complainant subsequently made amendments to the transcript, which were\naccepted by the publication.\n19. The\npublication noted that the complainant’s website stated: “In our opinion, 80%\nof individuals respond favourably to a dietary modification. The improvements\nmay include improved bowel habit, general health and well being, appetite and\nweight regulation, and in children with autism, improved behaviours and sleep\npatterns, eye contact, social communication and sensory issues.” The\npublication said that it was therefore not misleading to report that the\ncomplainant’s practice “claims to have improved the development of 80 per cent\nof its patients”.\n20. The\npublication referred to a section of the transcript which stated the following:\nComplainant:\nNumber one is the diet – the diet, we have to change it. It is almost certain\nthat your daughter is in pain and that’s why she wakes up. This is in part\nbecause of the diet.\n[...]\nComplainant:\nWell as I said, we remove the food which are pro-inflammatory. These foods\ncontribute to maintaining inflammation. The inflammation could have been\ntriggered by the genetics or the vaccine but it is maintained. She is\ndisplaying issues of health because of a sudden onset of challenging\nbehavioural and self injurious behaviour; she is in pain. Until you change the\ndiet, that pain will not stop. There is no magic pill in autism. Zero. I cannot\ngive you one pill which will take it away.\nThe\npublication therefore said it was not inaccurate to report that the complainant\nhad said that the child’s diet could be behind her “challenging behavioural\nissues”. It added that the article as a whole made clear that the complainant’s\nadvice was change to the child’s diet in general, but stated that the\ncomplainant went into a lot of detail regarding a recipe for organic chicken\nnuggets. It said where the complainant had said that “number one is diet” and\nthat “this is in part because of the diet” and that she stated in another part\nof the transcript that children had “fully recovered” from her plan it was not\nmisleading to report that she had said that organic chicken nuggets could\nalleviate autism. Whilst it did not accept a breach of Clause 1, the\npublication offered to publish the following as a footnote to the article:\nWe are\nhappy to make clear Dr Amet's suggestion of removing gluten from home-made\nchicken nuggets is part of her wider diet plan, to help people with autism.\nAlways seek medical advice before starting any new treatment or diet.    \nThe\npublication said that where many of the recipes supplied by the complainant\nwere vegan, it was not inaccurate to report that she had recommended “vegan”\nrecipes. The publication accepted the complainant’s position that the National\nInstitute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines did not recommend a change\nof diet “for the management of core features of autism in children and young\npeople\", and said that this did not contradict what was said in the\narticle. It also said that there was no reference to the guidelines being\nupdated from 2013 in the article, and added that the NHS stated that “special\ndiets” do not work for treating autism. The publication said that during the\ninterview the complainant had not distinguished between the “core features” of autism\nand what she had described as “physical comorbidities”, and noted that the\ncomplainant had said during the interview, and published on her website that\ndiet improved behaviour and social communication, which were considered as core\nfeatures of autism by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. It\nwas therefore not misleading to say the body had “discredited [a change in\ndiet] as a way of managing autism in young people”. It said the study referred\nto by the complainant, whilst considered beneficial, did not outweigh the\ncategorical advice not to use exclusion diets.\n21. It\nsaid that the article did not question or dispute the complainant’s\ncertifications, but said that the complainant did portray herself as an autism\nexpert. It noted that the complainant had said that “some children have fully\nrecovered”, despite NHS guidance saying there is no cure or treatment for\nautism.\n22. The\npublication stated that the complainant not being aware of the concerns being\nraised by parents was not a breach of Clause 1. It reiterated that this was an\nimportant factor for the publication’s investigation.\n23. The\npublication stated that the complainant had linked the MMR vaccine to autism.\nand supplied the following passage from the transcript:\nComplainant:\nYes,…basically, as you know the NHS and the official position is there’s no\nlink between vaccination and it [...]\nThere’s\nbeen quite a number of studies which have suggested otherwise and of course,\nquite a lot of the opinion has been suppressed and people have been attacked\nfor questioning the safety of vaccination, especially MMR […]\nAs far\nas I’m concerned I have heard the story you are sharing, over and over - I have\nno doubt there are children who are affected by this. It actually fits very\nwell with what we understand autism for some children to be. The animal model\nwhere you mimic infections when you basically cause a burdening of the immune\nsystem and vaccination is a means to cause the system to be overwhelmed. That\ncauses inflammation, this affects brain function. This can link to gut issues,\nthis can link to behaviour And unfortunately sometimes these changes are\nessentially irreversible.\nInvestigator:\nIt’s terrible they’ve been getting away from it for so long.\nComplainant:\nYes, it is terrible. I remain - I don’t remain hopeful - but I believe\neventually it will be accepted. I believe it will be. It only needs the right\nperson in the right place -a president whose child has the same issue could\ncompletely change the whole thing and completely stop it. One person alone in\nthe right place a the right time could do that but at the moment all\nscientists, all doctors, who have raised their concern have been attacked.\nBasically you can’t do anything. Even doctors do not do their job because\nnormally when there is an adverse reaction you have to complete a form which is\ncalled a yellow card to flag the adverse reaction to this. But they don’t do\nthis because they say oh no, there is no link - therefore they’re not even\nreporting it, saying autism is starting off at 18 months of age, it’s just a\ncoincidence. But the reality is we have children who have been given the\nvaccination earlier than planned and they’ve developed the signs of autism at\neight months , we equally have children who receive the vaccination much later,\neven age of eight, and they develop sign of autism at that point. And that\ndoesn’t fit with the textbook description of autism and when you develop it.\n24. The\npublication provided the emails that had been sent to experts, and the response\nof the doctor named in the article, which included the quote that was reported.\nIt also stated that two other experts had commented, but had asked to remain\nanonymous.\n25. The\npublication said that the investigator had been sent links to two forms to\ncomplete with questions about her daughter ahead of the meeting. One of the\nquestionnaires that was sent to the investigator was from a website which used\nthe tagline 'Autism is Treatable'. It said, therefore, it was not misleading to\nreport that the investigator had been sent a questionnaire with this tagline.\n26. The\npublication did not accept that the complainant had not recommended tests and\n“anti-inflammatories”. It acknowledged that the complainant had initially\nadvised that “before investing in tests I would suggest you would start with\nthe diet” but said that the complainant had said that the child should “go on\nto” anti-inflammatory supplements straight away. The complainant also explained\nthat there were multiple tests that could be done at home in order to assess\nthe patient’s health.\n27. The\npublication noted that after the session, the complainant sent a document\ndescribing tests she would “recommend”, which gave information on blood, urine,\nhair and stool tests, the total cost of which was £971.90. The publication also\nnoted that during the interview, the complainant had said she worked with\nmedical doctors who worked in Geneva.\n28. The\npublication did not accept that the use of the image of the complainant in the\narticle breached Clause 2 (Privacy). It said the image simply showed her\nlikeness and there was no information included in respect of which the\ncomplainant had a reasonable expectation of privacy. The publication also said\nthat the use of the image was justified as it demonstrated that the\ninvestigation had taken place. It also said that in any case, there is a strong\npublic interest in relation to protecting public health and safety and preventing\nthe public from being misled by some statement or action of that individual.\n29. The\ncomplainant said that the offered correction did not resolve her complaint, as\nshe did not suggest removing gluten from homemade chicken nuggets or a wider\ndiet plan “to help people with autism”, but in order to help the specific case\nof the fictitious child presented to her by the investigator. The complainant\nnoted that she had been told the child ate chicken nuggets every day with no\nfruit or vegetables, and that she had only offered chicken nuggets as tailored\nto this individual.\n30.\nAfter reviewing the email that was sent to the expert by the publication\nseeking a comment for inclusion in the articles, the complainant said it\ncontained multiple inaccuracies. She said that the quote from the expert was,\ntherefore, gained on false pretences, and consequently that it was misleading\nto include the expert’s comments in the article. The email from the publication\nincluded the following information: it said the complainant had “insisted” and\nhad “no doubt” the MMR jab was linked to autism, which the complainant\ndisputed; it said she had recommended “anti-inflammatories” would help the\nchild, when she said that this sounded as if she had recommended drugs, when in\nfact she had recommended supplements with anti-inflammatory properties and an\nanti-inflammatory diet; it stated “given that parents may be taken in by claims\nand persuaded to spend a lot under the belief their child's autism can be\n'treated'” which the complainant said was inaccurate as she did not persuade\nparents who were free to choose what care they thought would be helpful to them\nand she did not “make claims”; it referred to “concern about unregulated\nprivate clinics in general”, which the complainant said was misleading as she\nwas not required to register with a regulatory body; it did not list all of the\nrecipes sent and only set out a few, describing them as “vegan” recipes; it\nreferred to the National Institute of Health Care and Excellence discrediting\nexclusion diets; it said that the complainant had blamed the child’s behaviour\non her diet which caused her to be “in pain”, which the complainant said was\nnot accurate and omitted that she had also recommended laboratory testing for\nthe further health causes.\n31. The\npublication did not accept that the email sent to the expert was inaccurate. It\nsaid that the allegations specifically about the complainant were accurate, for\nthe reasons previously cited, and that it was not inaccurate to describe\nnutritional supplements with anti-inflammatory benefits as\n“anti-inflammatories”.  It said that the\nreference to parents being “taken in by claims and persuaded to spend a lot\nunder the belief their child's autism can be 'treated'” and “unregulated clinics”\nwas context for the expert and more general rather than being specifically\nabout the complainant. It noted the complainant was not named in the email.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2\n(Privacy)*\ni)\nEveryone is entitled to respect for their private and family life, home,\nphysical and mental health, and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii)\nEditors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private\nlife without consent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy, account will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of\ninformation and the extent to which the material complained about is already in\nthe public domain or will become so.\niii) It\nis unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or\nprivate places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nClause\n10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge)*\ni) The\npress must not seek to obtain or publish material acquired by using hidden\ncameras or clandestine listening devices; or by intercepting private or mobile\ntelephone calls, messages or emails; or by the unauthorised removal of\ndocuments or photographs; or by accessing digitally-held information without\nconsent.\nii)\nEngaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including by agents or\nintermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public interest and then\nonly when the material cannot be obtained by other means.\nThe\nPublic Interest\nThere\nmay be exceptions to the clauses marked * where they can be demonstrated to be\nin the public interest.\n1. The\npublic interest includes, but is not confined to:\n· Detecting\nor exposing crime, or the threat of crime, or serious impropriety.\n· Protecting\npublic health or safety.\n· Protecting\nthe public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or\norganisation.\n· Disclosing\na person or organisation’s failure or likely failure to comply with any\nobligation to which they are subject.\n· Disclosing\na miscarriage of justice.\n· Raising\nor contributing to a matter of public debate, including serious cases of\nimpropriety, unethical conduct or incompetence concerning the public.\n· Disclosing\nconcealment, or likely concealment, of any of the above.\n2.

The\nregulator will consider the extent to which material is already in the public\ndomain or will become so.\n4.\nEditors invoking the public interest will need to demonstrate that they\nreasonably believed publication - or journalistic activity taken with a view to\npublication – would both serve, and be proportionate to, the public interest\nand explain how they reached that decision at the time.\n5. An\nexceptional public interest would need to be demonstrated to over-ride the\nnormally paramount interests of children under 16.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n32. The\nEditors’ Code makes clear that subterfuge and misrepresentation can be\njustified in the public interest, which includes protecting public health and\nsafety. The Committee considered that the investigation into a practitioner who\noffers paid services to help children with autism could be in the public\ninterest as it was an issue which may concern the protection of public health\nand safety. \n33. The\npublication had commissioned an investigator who had knowledge of the subject,\nwho engaged in misrepresentation and subterfuge in order to create a fake\npersona to pose as a parent of an autistic child and participate in a video\nconsultation. The Committee noted that the complainant had concerns that the\ninvestigator was not impartial – but made clear that this is not a question\nthat fell under the Editors’ Code, or relevant to the requirements under Clause\n10.\n34. The\nnewspaper said it had been contacted by a source, and had been put in touch\nwith a further source, both of whom wished to remain anonymous, who raised\nconcerns about the complainant’s firm and the treatments recommended for autism.\nThe publication also noted several parts of the complainant’s website which\nprovided advice which appeared to contradict NHS and the National Institute for\nHealth and Care Excellence guidelines and advice for autism. The newspaper had\ndemonstrated that it had considered what information might be obtained from the\nuse of clandestine devices and subterfuge in advance of the investigation, by\ndiscussing several questions with the editor. It had also considered the\nproportionality of the investigation, and it was reasonable for the journalist\nand newspaper to believe that they would be unable to ascertain the\ncomplainant’s usual advice for children with autism, without employing\nsubterfuge and misrepresentation. The Committee noted that a video consultation\nwas the complainant’s usual method of consulting potential clients, and that\nthe newspaper had simply arranged a consultation by the same method. The use of\nmisrepresentation and subterfuge was justified in the public interest, in order\nto investigate whether the public might be being misled by the actions of the\ncomplainant. \n35. The\npublication considered that its investigation had demonstrated that the\ncomplainant had recommended exclusion diets against NHS advice and the National\nInstitute for Health and Care Excellence guidelines; that the complainant had\nsuggested that there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism; and that\nthe complainant believed that studies confirming a link between the two had\nbeen supressed. Where these views appeared to have been expressed by a health\nprofessional, the Committee considered that the material gathered during the\ninvestigation concerned the protection of public health and safety and that its\npublication was justified in the public interest.\n36. The\npublication had appropriately and satisfactorily considered the issues raised\nunder the Code, both prior to commissioning the investigation and publication\nof the information. The Committee found that the newspaper had satisfied the\nrequirements of the public interest section of the Code; there was no breach of\nClause 10.\n37. With\nregards to the accuracy of the article, it had stated that the complainant had\nrecommended “organic chicken nuggets” as part of an exclusion diet to alleviate\nthe symptoms of autism. The complainant accepted that chicken nuggets had been\na part of a wider exclusion diet she had recommended, and said that this was\nbased on the child’s profile the publication had created in order to engage in\na video consultation with the complainant, a reference to which was included in\nthe article. As the context for recommending chicken nuggets was included\nwithin the article, there was no breach of Clause 1 on this point. Where many\nof the recipes sent by the complainant to the investigator were vegan, it was\nnot inaccurate to report that the complainant had sent “vegan recipes”. In\naddition, the complainant had said it was misleading for the article to report\nthat she said “there was ‘no magic pill’ for autism” and that she had never\nsaid that diet alone would take away autism. As noted in paragraph 15 above,\nasked if anything would ‘take it away’, she had said: “Number one is the\ndiet….until you change the diet, that pain will not stop…” The complainant had\nalso said “There is no magic pill in autism. \nZero.  I cannot give you one pill\nwhich will take it away”. During the course of the investigation, the\ncomplainant accepted she had said these quotes and there was no breach of the\nCode on these points.\n38. It\nwas accepted by both parties that the National Institute for Health and Care\nExcellence did not recommend a change of diet to manage what it described as\nthe core features of autism”. These guidelines described the core features of\nautism as “differences and impairments in reciprocal social interaction and\nsocial communication, combined with restricted and stereotyped interests and\nactivities, and rigid and repetitive behaviours in children and young people”.\nThe complainant had said that communication could be helped by a change in\ndiet. It was, therefore, not misleading for the article to report that the\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence had discredited a change in\ndiet as a way of managing autism in young people, where the body did not\nrecommend a change in diet in order to manage the features which had been\nreferred to by the complainant. There was no breach of Clause 1.\n39. The\ncomplainant had accepted that her personal page on her website stated \"I\nhave an expertise in autism\". The Committee acknowledged that the\ncomplainant had many qualifications, certificates and publications in the field\nof autism. However, as the complainant described herself as having an\nexpertise, and where the article did not cast doubt on the complainant’s\nqualifications and certificates, it was not inaccurate to describe her as a\n“self-proclaimed” autism expert, and there was no breach of Clause 1.\n40. The\ncomplainant had said she doubted that a parent had raised concerns about her,\nas she was not aware of any parents having such claims, and did not believe\nthat they would approach a newspaper about them. Whilst it may have surprised\nthe complainant that a parent had gone to the newspaper with such concerns,\nthis complaint was based on speculation alone, and the publication had a duty\nto protect its sources under Clause 14. There were no grounds for the Committee\nto support a breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n41.\nWhere the complainant accepted that her website said “In our opinion, 80% of\nindividuals respond favourably to a dietary modification. The improvements may\ninclude improved bowel habit, general health and well being, appetite and\nweight regulation, and in children with autism, improved behaviours and sleep\npatterns, eye contact, social communication and sensory issues”. It was,\ntherefore, not misleading for the article to state that the complainant’s\npractice claimed to have improved the development of 80% of its patients”.\nThere was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n42. The\ncomplainant said she had never suggested that the MMR vaccine was linked to\nautism. However, the complainant accepted the accuracy of the transcript as\ndetailed in paragraph 19 of this decision. The Committee considered that the\ncomplainant’s position as recorded in the agreed transcript of the meeting, as\nquoted above, could accurately be characterised as the complainant suggesting a\nlink between autism and the MMR vaccine. Additionally, where the complainant\naccepted that she had said: “all doctors, who have raised their concern have\nbeen attacked. Basically you can’t do anything. Even doctors do not do their\njob”, it was not inaccurate to report that she had said that “doctors ‘do not\ndo their job’”, and that studies which linked the two had been “suppressed”.  The fact that the investigator had asked\nquestions specifically about this did not make reporting the complainant’s\nresponse misleading. There was no breach of Clause 1 on these points.\nThe\ncomplainant accepted that the third-party website she used for questionnaires\ncontained a tagline that stated “autism is treatable”. The link to the third\nparty website was included in the questionnaire sent to the investigator. In\naddition, the Committee noted that whilst the complainant had said that there\nis no “cure” or “treatment” for autism, the name of her company was “Autism\nTreatment Plus”. The publication appeared to acknowledge that the questionnaire\ndid not carry the tagline. Nonetheless, where the third-party website linked to\nin the questionnaire emailed to the investigator used this tagline and the\ncomplainant’s company name referred to “Autism Treatment”, it was not\nsignificantly inaccurate to report that the investigator had been sent a\nquestionnaire with the tagline “autism is treatable”. There was no breach of\nClause 1 on this point.\n44. The\ncomplainant accepted that she had said “We will need to assess the full extent\nof your daughters’ health through laboratory testing” and had then sent a\ndocument to the investigator after the session which stated, “I enclose below\nsome information below on the tests we recommend”. The complainant had also\naccepted that the tests would be analysed, and prescriptions would be made by\ndoctors in Geneva. On this basis, it was not misleading for the article to report\nthat the complainant had recommended tests, or that treatment would involve\nworking “with medics in Geneva”. In addition, the Committee found that it was\nnot significantly inaccurate to describe supplements with anti-inflammatory\nproperties as “anti-inflammatories”. \nThere was no breach of Clause 1 on these points.\n45. For\nthe reasons given above, the Committee found that the email which had been sent\nby the publication to the expert, which contained the same allegations as\nwithin the article, was not inaccurate. It was, therefore, not inaccurate to\ninclude the quote provided by the expert in the article in response to the\nallegations. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n46. The\nCommittee noted that the image of the complainant used in the article was taken\nthrough a video platform whilst she was in her home, and was taken without the\ncomplainant’s consent or knowledge. However, it noted that it was taken whilst\nthe complainant was acting in her professional capacity, and provided a view of\nher that she openly shared with her clients and potential clients without\nrestrictions, through her video consultations. In such circumstances, the\nCommittee considered that the complainant did not have the same expectation of\nprivacy as someone’s home would normally afford. In addition, the Committee\nnoted that the image had been published to demonstrate that the investigation\nhad taken place. In all the circumstances, the Committee did not find that the\npublication of the image intruded into the complainant’s private life, and\nthere was no breach of Clause 2.\nConclusions\n47.
