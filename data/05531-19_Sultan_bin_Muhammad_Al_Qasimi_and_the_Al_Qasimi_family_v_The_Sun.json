Sultan bin Muhammad Al Qasimi and the Al Qasimi family\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The Sun\nbreached Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock) in an article headlined\n“PRINCE DIES IN SEX AND DRUGS ORGY” published on 3 July 2019, and in an article\nheadlined “ORGY PRINCE’S FUNERAL”, published on 4 July 2019.\n2. The first article reported that Sheikh Khalid bin Sultan\nAl Qasimi, an Arab prince, had been found dead in his home “amid claims of a\ndrug-fuelled orgy”. It said that police “were said to have found a quantity of\nClass A drugs”. It quoted a source who had said there had “apparently been a\nparty where some guests were taking drugs and having sex”; that it was\n“suspected that Sheikh Khalid may have died suddenly as a result of taking\ndrugs”; and that “as well as the police inquiry, an urgent internal probe has\nbeen ordered and staff have been ordered to keep quiet”. The article reported\nthat detectives were treating the prince’s death as “unexplained” and had made\nno arrests. The article also reported that the prince’s family owned a property\nin Sussex where his brother had been found dead from a heroin overdose in 1999.\n3. The first article was published in substantially the same\nform online on 2 July 2019, with the headline “’Orgy death’ Emir of Sharjah’s\nson Prince Khalid Al Qasimi died aged 39 at ‘sex and drugs orgy’”.\n4. The second article reported that the prince had been\n“laid to rest” following his death “amid claims of a drug-fuelled orgy”. It\nsaid that tens of thousands of mourners had attended his funeral in the UAE.\nThe piece noted that the previous day, the newspaper had “revealed claims he\nattended a sex and drugs party” the evening before his death. The article was\nillustrated with an image of the funeral ceremony which showed his father,\namongst other mourners, praying as he stood over his son’s body; his father’s\nface had been circled in red to identify him. The second article was not\npublished online.\n5. The complainants said that the newspaper’s coverage of\nthe death of Prince Khalid and the timing of its articles had been insensitive\nin breach of Clause 4. They said that the reporting was flippant and\ngratuitous; it represented a clear intrusion into their grief and a failure to\nact with sympathy when reporting on a tragic event. While an attempt had been\nmade to contact the UAE Embassy before the articles were published, no attempt\nhad been made to contact the family directly.\n6. The complainants expressed concern that the articles had\nincluded excessive speculation on the cause of the prince’s death – including\nin the headlines. This was unnecessary and insensitive given that nothing had\nbeen confirmed by the police or the coroner. They said that the newspaper had\nalso presented this speculation in a sensationalist manner, which had demeaned\nthe prince’s death. The complainants said that the first article had been\npublished online the day after Prince Khalid’s death, and the print version was\npublished despite the fact that a notice had been circulated on 3 July, which\nhad alerted the newspaper to the family’s concerns regarding the publication of\nspeculation on the cause of the prince’s death. The first article had stated\nthat the prince had died “amid claims of a drug-fuelled orgy”; that the prince\n“may have died suddenly as a result of taking drugs”; and that police were said\nto have found “a quantity of Class A drugs”. They also considered that the\nreference to the death of his brother from a heroin overdose was insensitive;\nthis had deepened the family’s hurt and distress. \n7.  The complainants\nsaid that the online version of the first article had been updated with images\nand video taken during the funeral, which featured the prince’s body being\ncarried and the face of his grieving father. This material juxtaposed with the\n“sensationalist” headline and the speculation on the circumstances of the death\nwas insensitive. \n8. The complainants said that the second article had been\npublished the day after the prince’s funeral. They expressed concern that it\nhad repeated earlier references to the prince’s death as one resulting from a\n“drug-fuelled orgy”, caused by “suspected drug overdose” in the circumstances\nof a “sex and drugs party”. This article had also been illustrated with an\nexceedingly insensitive photo taken during Prince Khalid’s funeral, which showed\nhis covered body and his grieving father with his face circled, which the\ncomplainants said had emphasised to readers his hurt expression.\n9. The complainants said that their concerns were framed in\nthe context of other coverage of the prince’s death, which had been published\nby another title owned by the same publishing group as The Sun, News Group\nNewspapers Ltd (NGN).\n10. The newspaper expressed its condolences to the\ncomplainants for their tragic loss, and it acknowledged that media coverage of\na death can sometimes be unwelcome. It nevertheless denied that its coverage\nhad been insensitive in breach of the Code.\n11. The newspaper said that it was entitled to report the\nnews of a death and there was a public interest in doing so – the family had\nnot learned of the prince’s death through its reporting. It did not accept that\nmentioning drugs and sex in the context of a death had represented a failure to\nhandle publication sensitively.\n12. The newspaper said that one of its highly experienced\njournalists had been informed by a reliable, confidential source that a party\nhad been held at the prince’s apartment the night before his death at which the\nguests and the host had been drinking, taking drugs and having sex, and that\nClass A drugs had been found. The newspaper noted that the accuracy of this\ninformation had not been questioned, and it said that the reporter had heard\nsubsequently from additional sources that it was correct. It argued that the\nfact that there had not yet been a finding by a coroner was irrelevant.\n13. The newspaper said that it had attempted to contact the\ncomplainants before publication: a reporter had contacted the United Arab\nEmirates Embassy in London and had repeatedly given them an opportunity to\ncomment. No response was received. In addition, the reporter had contacted the\npolice, and they had issued a statement confirming that they had been called by\nthe ambulance service to the death of a man.\n14. The newspaper said that its articles had concerned the\nfact of the death; the fact of the funeral; and an explanation of who Prince\nKhalid was. The articles had not gone into detail about the alleged circumstances\nof Prince Khalid’s death. They had simply reported claims that he had died amid\na sex and drugs party; no further information had been given about, for\nexample, the details of his sex life, his sexual preferences or the types of\ndrugs that had been found in the flat. It also considered that it was entirely\nlegitimate to note in the articles that the prince’s brother had died of a\ndrugs overdose in 1999.\n15. The newspaper did not consider that the publication of\nthe photographs and video of the funeral ceremony was insensitive as the\nmaterial had been authorised and distributed to the media for the purposes of\npublication. It noted that it had come from the Sharjah Media Office and had\nbeen issued by the Emirates News Agency. In addition, it had been posted on the\nInstagram page of the Media Office of the ruler of Sharjah. The newspaper said\nthat it had been appropriate for it to circle the face of the prince’s father\nin one of the images so as to identify him from the others in the photograph.\nIt did not consider that this represented a breach of Clause 4.\n16. At the end of IPSO’s investigation, in order to support\nits position that its source had supplied accurate information, the newspaper\nprovided an article it had published which reported that the inquest into\nPrince Khalid’s death had heard that he had died “after bingeing on cocaine and\nsex drug GHB with another man”.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n17. Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings.\nFindings of the Committee on Procedural Point\n18. The complainants had directed their complaint at News\nGroup Newspapers Ltd (NGN), the publisher of The Sun, as well as thesun.co.uk,\nabout which the complainants had also submitted a complaint. The Committee\nnoted that IPSO considers complaints against individual publications, rather\nthan against publishing groups. This is because IPSO operates on the principle\nof editorial responsibility: publications make separate and distinct editorial\ndecisions and therefore one publication with its own editor cannot be held\nresponsible for what is published by another publication in the same group.\nFindings of the Committee\n19. The Committee first wished to express its condolences to\nthe complainants for their loss.\n20. The complainants had found the reporting process\ninsensitive, in particular the timing of the coverage and the fact that the\nnewspaper had not made direct contact with the family in advance of\npublication. While the Committee understood that the complainants had found the\nnewspaper’s coverage distressing to read, and their concern that the first\narticle was published the day after Prince Khalid’s death, the fact of\nsomeone’s death is not private, and there is a public interest in reporting on\na death.  Journalists have a right to\nreport the fact of a person’s death, even if surviving family members would\nprefer for there to be no reporting. The Committee noted that in this case, the\ndeceased was a high-profile fashion designer and a member of a royal family. It\nwas not insensitive in breach of the Code for the newspaper to have reported\nthe death of Prince Khalid the day after it happened, or to publish the second\narticle the day after his funeral.\n21. While the Committee acknowledged that the complainants\nwould have appreciated being notified of the first article before it was\npublished, the Code does not require that newspapers contact families in\nadvance of publishing reports of a death in order to comply with Clause 4;\nrather, it states that any such inquiries, if made, should be handled\nsensitively. Nonetheless, the Committee welcomed the fact that the newspaper\nhad attempted to contact the family through the United Arab Emirates Embassy in\nLondon.   \n22. The complainants had also expressed serious concern\nregarding the content of the articles and the presentation of the accounts. In\nparticular, they had objected to the reporting of “unconfirmed speculation” on\nthe circumstances in which the prince had died, which they considered to be\nexcessive and demeaning. However, the newspaper had reported information\nprovided by confidential sources about the circumstances in which the prince\nhad died. While the newspaper had reported – including in its headlines – that\n“sex”, “drugs” and an “orgy” had allegedly been involved, it had taken steps to\nlimit the level of detail published, avoiding excessive and gratuitous detail.\nThe Code does not require that newspapers sanitise information about the\ncircumstances of a death and it was not insensitive in breach of the Code for\nthe newspaper to have reported this information.\n23. The first article had included a brief reference to the\ndeath of Prince Khalid’s brother. This was factual information that was already\nin the public domain and was relevant in the context of the death of Prince\nKhalid. Publishing this information did not breach the Code.\n24. The second article had featured video and images of\nPrince Khalid’s funeral. The complainants objected to their publication, and in\nparticular the publication of photographs in which his father, one of the\ncomplainants, was circled.  Funerals,\nwhatever their nature, are highly sensitive occasions, and the Committee\nacknowledged the family’s distress. It was relevant, however, that the material\nunder complaint had previously been placed in the public domain with the\nfamily’s consent, and that it showed a televised state funeral of a prominent\nmember of the Sharjah royal family, rather than a private occasion. It was not\ninsensitive for the newspaper to have republished the broadcast footage and\ntaken still images from it to illustrate its coverage. Furthermore, it was not\ninsensitive for the newspaper to have cropped a photo of the prince’s father in\norder to show his face more clearly, or to circle his face in order to identify\nhim from the others in the photograph. This did not represent a failure to\nhandle publication with sensitivity.\nConclusion\n25. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial action required\n26. N/A.\n \nDate complaint received: 22/07/2019\nDate complaint concluded: 11/02/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
