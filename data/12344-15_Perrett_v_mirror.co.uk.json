Maria Perrett complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that mirror.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 3\n(Privacy) and Clause 9 (Reporting of crime) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in\nan article headlined “Charity worker was ‘murdered by next-door neighbour in\nnoise row sparked by son’s skateboard”, published on 15 June 2015. 2. The article was a court report of the trial of Trevor\nGibbon, who was accused of murder. He was later convicted and sentenced to 28\nyears in prison. 3. There was one reference to the complainant in the\narticle: “Gibbon and his partner, Maria Perrett, rebuffed repeated attempts by\nthe council and police to broker better relations…” The complainant said that\nthe statement was inaccurate, and that the inclusion of her name represented a\nbreach of Clause 3 and Clause 9; she requested that it be removed from the\narticle. The complainant had not been present in court. 4. The publication said that the article was an\naccurate report of the case as heard in open court. Several references to the\ncomplainant had been made during the prosecution’s opening remarks, including\nthe statement complained of. The publication declined to remove the\ncomplainant’s name from the article.Relevant Code Provisions5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published.iii) The press, whilst free to be partisan, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Clause 3 (Privacyi) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her\nprivate and family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.Clause 9 (Reporting of crime)i) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused\nof crime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they\nare genuinely relevant to the story.Findings of\nthe Committee 6. The publication had a responsibility to accurately\nreport the case as heard in open court. The complainant had not been present\nduring the hearing, and did not dispute that the court had heard the phrase\ncomplained of. There was no breach of Clause 1. 7. The publication had confirmed that the complainant had\nbeen referred to by the prosecution; she therefore had no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in relation to the proceedings, and was genuinely\nrelevant to the reporting of the case. There was no breach of Clause 3 or\nClause 9.Conclusions 8. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial Action RequiredN/A \nDate complaint received:\n04/12/2015 Date decision issued:\n29/04/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
