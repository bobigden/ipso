Jacqueline\nMillband complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the\nDaily Mail breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 6 (Children) of the Editors’\nCode of Practice in an article headlined “Children of RAF personnel march to\nRussian embassy to protest against Vladimir Putin’s ‘war crimes’ in Aleppo”,\npublished on 24 October 2016.\n2. The complainant\nexpressed concern that the newspaper had inaccurately reported that children,\nincluding her daughter, had marched to the Russian Embassy in protest against\nRussia’s military action in Syria. In fact, the children had been to the\nRussian Embassy to promote a charity single they had recorded.  She also said that the children had not\nvisited or marched to the Syrian Embassy, as reported. In addition, she\nexpressed concern that by publishing the full names of the children, their\nsafety had been put at risk.\n3. The newspaper\nsaid that it had reported information supplied by a charity fundraiser and\ncampaigner who had said that he was representing the children. It was clear\nthat he had discussed the children’s visit to London with their parents and had\nobtained their consent for them to be named and photographed for the article.\nIt said that the charity fundraiser had said that the single had been recorded\nto persuade world leaders to stop their indiscriminate bombing in Aleppo, and\nit had reported the information in good faith. To resolve the complaint, the\nnewspaper offered to remove the name of the complainant’s daughter and the references\nto the children “marching” to the Russian and Syrian Embassies from the\narticle.\nRelevant Code provisions\n4. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 6 (Children)\ni) All pupils should be free to complete their time at\nschool without unnecessary intrusion.\nii) They must not be approached or photographed at school\nwithout permission of the school authorities.\niii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or\nphotographed on issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a\ncustodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.\niv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material\ninvolving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their\nchildren or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.\nv) Editors must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a\nparent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child's\nprivate life.\nMediated outcome\n5. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter. \n6. The newspaper\nremoved the name of the complainant’s daughter from the article, and took steps\nto have the article removed from other websites that had published the story.\n7. The complainant\nsaid that the newspaper’s offer would resolve the matter to her satisfaction.\n8. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 12/12/2016Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 14/02/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
