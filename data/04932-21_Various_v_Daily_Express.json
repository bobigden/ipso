The Independent Press Standards Organisation received\nvarious complaints that the Daily Express breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “UK gets new lung cancer\ndrug...thanks to Brexit deal”, published on 7 May 2021.\n2. The article reported that the UK had authorised a “new\nlung cancer drug” under an international scheme that the country was “able to\njoin after Brexit” having signed up to the US-led Project Orbis in January\n2021. It reported that the drug – called Osimertinib – was made by AstraZeneca\nand sold under the brand name Tagrisso. It stated that this medication was\ntaken in tablet form and “originally licensed to treat patients with mid and\nlater stage non-small cell lung cancer who carry a gene mutation called EGFR”\nbut has since “been extended to include those in early-stage disease after the\ncancer is surgically removed.” The article went on to include the comments made\nby the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock MP, who said that “leaving the European\nUnion (EU) had presented [the country] with the opportunity to join Project\nOrbis - a collaboration with the top regulators around the world – to speed up\nthe time it takes to get new medicines to patients”, adding that he was\ndelighted to see the “first results” of this undertaking.  He said that the “ground-breaking drug for\nlung cancer” would soon benefit hundreds of patients across the UK. \n3. A substantially similar version of the article also\nappeared online under the headline “UK gets new lung cancer drug under\ninternational scheme thanks to Brexit deal”.\n4. IPSO received 34 complaints about this article.\nComplainants said the headline was inaccurate and misleading on two points.\nFirst, to report that there was a “new lung cancer drug” given that the\nmedication ‘Tagrisso’ was already licensed and available to EU countries,\nincluding the UK, following its approval by the European Medicines Agency (EMA)\nin 2016. Second, to report that “thanks to Brexit” the UK was able to authorise\nthis “new drug”, given that it had been available for use since 2016.\n5. The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Editors’\nCode on either point. The newspaper accepted that the drug ‘Tagrisso’ had\noriginally been licensed in the UK to treat patients with mild and later stage\nnon-small lung cancer. However, it said that the recent authorisation had\nallowed a new use of the medication, earlier in the disease, that extended its\nuse to a further cohort of patients, who were previously ineligible.  It said that this was made clear in the body\nof the article, which said the drug had been “originally licensed to treat\npatients with mid and later stage non-small cell lung cancer who carry a gene\nmutation called EGFR” but has since “been extended to include those in early-stage\ndisease after the cancer is surgically removed.” In such circumstances, the\nnewspaper said the headline was not significantly misleading to describe the\nmedication as “a new cancer drug”.  \n6. In regard to the second point of complaint, the newspaper\nsaid the article was based upon a press release issued by the UK’s Medicines\nand Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). This included the statement\nmade by the Health Secretary, Matt Hancock MP, who said that “leaving the EU\n[had] presented [the UK] with the opportunity to join Project Orbis” and\nauthorise the “ground-breaking drug”. \nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nFindings of the Committee\n7. In considering the care taken by the newspaper, the\nCommittee had regard to the context of the article. The Committee noted that\nthe article reported on an announcement by the MHRA and the then Health\nSecretary, Matt Hancock MP, with the latter describing the authorisation of the\ndrug ‘Osimertinib’ in the context of “new medicines” being brought to the UK\nmarket after Brexit. In addition, the Committee noted that the article had made\nclear the basis for the claim, specifically that the drug had been approved for\na new usage. On this basis, the Committee concluded that there was no failure\nto take care over the accuracy of the article in breach of Clause 1 (i). \n8. The Committee next considered whether the article\ncontained significant inaccuracies or was significantly misleading. It was not\nin dispute that, as explained in the text of the article, the drug had been\nauthorised for use in a new way to treat cancer, and would therefore be\navailable to a new set of patients. In addition, the body of the article made\nclear that, according to the former Health Secretary, the UK’s departure from\nthe EU had afforded it the opportunity to join Project Orbis, which had been\nresponsible for approving the use of the drug for this new treatment of cancer\npatients – a treatment which had not yet been approved by the EU regulator. In\nsuch circumstances, and taking into account the above, the Committee did not\nconsider the article significantly inaccurate or misleading as to require\ncorrection under Clause 1 (ii). There was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusion\n9. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial Action Required10.
