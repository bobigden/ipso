Julia Larden complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that The Times breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2\n(Privacy) of the Editors' Code of Practice in an article headlined \"Labour\nurged to investigate claims of vote-rigging\" published on 9 October 2018.2. The article appeared online under the headline\n\"Labour urged to investigate claims of vote-rigging in Birmingham party\nelections\" published on 9 October 2018. The online article appeared in\nmuch the same format as the print version.3. The article\nreported that the Labour Party had been urged to send an independent observer\nto investigate claims that votes had been rigged in constituency party\nelections in Yardley, Birmingham. It reported that the complainant, described\nas the \"local party's vice-chairwoman\" had sent an email to Labour\nparty officials raising concerns of a \"visible practice\" whereby\ngroups of Asian women who could not speak English, had been shown how to vote.\nThe article claimed that a meeting in the neighbouring Hodge Hill constituency\nhad \"descended into chaos\" after activists attempted to disrupt votes\nnot going their way.4. The complainant said the article represented an intrusion\ninto her private life in breach of Clause 2 (Privacy). She said the email was a\nconfidential and private communication intended for its recipients and not for\ncirculation in the public domain; as a whistle-blower, she was entitled to\nprivacy. The complainant said the article's publication had damaged her\nreputation and caused her professional difficulties.5. The complainant said the article was inaccurate as it\nreported that she was vice chair of Yardley CLP, when she was vice-chair\n(policy). She also disputed that the Hodge Hill meeting had \"descended\ninto chaos\" and said the article had given the misleading impression that\nshe had made this claim.6. The newspaper denied any breach of the Code. It said that\nthe email was not a private communication, it was written in her professional\ncapacity as an elected official of the local branch of a national political\nparty, to other senior party figures concerning a \"visible practice\".\nThe email was not marked 'private' or 'confidential' and did not report any\nprivate or sensitive information about her.7. The newspaper denied the article was inaccurate, the\ncomplainant had described her position as \"vice chair (policy)\" in\nthe email. That the constituency party had several vice-chairs did not make\nthis point misleading. The newspaper said that its report of the Hodge Hill\nmeeting was based on a first-hand account.8. While denying a breach of the Code, the newspaper said\nthat the article was in the public interest and all the examples cited in the\nEditors' Code were relevant in this case.Relevant Code Provisions9. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Clause 2 (Privacy)i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.The Public InterestThere may be exceptions to the clauses marked * where they\ncan be demonstrated to be in the public interest.1. The public interest includes, but is not confined to:• Detecting\nor exposing crime, or the threat of crime, or serious impropriety. • Protecting\npublic health or safety.• Protecting\nthe public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or\norganisation.• Disclosing\na person or organisation’s failure or likely failure to comply with any\nobligation to which they are subject.• Disclosing\na miscarriage of justice.• Raising or\ncontributing to a matter of public debate, including serious cases of\nimpropriety, unethical conduct or incompetence concerning the public.• Disclosing\nconcealment, or likely concealment, of any of the above.2. There is a public interest in freedom of expression\nitself.3. The regulator will consider the extent to which material\nis already in the public domain or will become so.4. Editors invoking the public interest will need to\ndemonstrate that they reasonably believed publication - or journalistic\nactivity taken with a view to publication – would both serve, and be\nproportionate to, the public interest and explain how they reached that\ndecision at the time.5. An exceptional public interest would need to be\ndemonstrated to over-ride the normally paramount interests of children under\n16.Mediated Outcome10. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.11. During IPSO's investigation, the newspaper offered to\nprovide a personal letter to the complainant explaining that she did not\nprovide it with the information in the email, and apologising for any personal\ndifficulty caused.12. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto her satisfaction.13. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 18/10/2018Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 19/12/2018\n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
