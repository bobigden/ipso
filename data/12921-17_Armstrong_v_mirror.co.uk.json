Katharine\nArmstrong complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nmirror.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2 (Privacy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Man fleeing terror attack\nwith pint 'identified' - and why he couldn't leave his beer”, published on 5\nJune 2017.\n2. The article\nreported on speculation surrounding the identity of a man who was photographed\nfollowing the London Bridge terror attack, holding a pint, amongst a crowd of\npeople who were fleeing the incident. The article said that “London's new\npint-clutching, terrorist defying-national hero is apparently from Liverpool –\nand close to being identified”. It said that a Facebook post from “an alleged\nfamily member” had claimed that the man was from Merseyside, and said that the\nLiverpool Echo had named the “gallant pint runner”. The article contained a\nquote from the Facebook post: \"So that guy with the pint? Yes, that’s the\nelusive [name]. That’s what happens when you’re a Scouser paying London pint\nprices.\" The article did not name the author of this post.\n3. The complainant,\nthe sister of the man pictured and the author of the Facebook post, expressed\nsignificant concern that her comments, which she had published on her Facebook\naccount, had been published in the article. She said that she had not shared\nher comments publicly: her Facebook privacy settings had meant that her post\nwould have been visible to many of her Facebook friends, as well as,\npotentially, the friends of the seven people that she had “tagged” in the post.\nHowever, the complainant explained that not all of the individuals outside of\nher Facebook network would have been able to view her post, as not all of the\npeople she had “tagged” had approved the post to be visible on their timeline.\n4. The complainant\nfurther said that when she had seen the photograph circulating on social media\nand had then published her Facebook post, she had been speculating on the\nidentity of the man pictured. While the publication had reported her post\naccurately, no further steps were taken by the newspaper to establish the\nveracity of her claims.\n5. The publication\ndid not accept that the publication of the comments which the complainant had\nmade on Facebook, represented an intrusion into her privacy, or that there had\nbeen a failure to take care over the accuracy of the article. It said that the\nphotograph of the complainant’s brother had been widely shared on social media\nand by other publications following the incident at London Bridge. The\npublication said that the story had been based on an article which had been\npreviously published by the Liverpool Echo, as made clear in the article. It\nsaid that as the complainant had tagged the eight people in her post, her privacy\nsettings were such that the post could be visible to an audience in the\nhundreds or possibly thousands, depending on how many Facebook friends the\ncomplainant and the eight tagged people had at the time.\nRelevant Code provisions\n6.    Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2 (Privacy)*\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nFindings of the Committee\n7. The Committee\nrecognised the importance of reporting on the immediate aftermath of a terror\nattack in a sensitive manner and acknowledged the complainant’s concern about\nthe publication of the information relating to her Facebook post. In\nconsidering whether the complainant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in\nrelation to this information, the Committee carefully analysed the nature of\nthe information which had been published about her, and the extent of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosure of that information.\n8. The article had\nreported the complainant’s comments, which had identified her brother’s name\nand which had conveyed her humorous explanation of his apparent reaction to the\nincident. The fact that the complainant’s brother was, or appeared to be, the\nperson photographed, was not private information about her; the information\nabout her was limited to the nature of her comments and the fact of her\nidentification of him. The article had not named the complainant as the author\nof these comments, nor had the article identified the relationship between her\nand her brother.\n9. The Committee also\nconsidered the manner in which the information contained in the article had\nbeen obtained. The Committee noted the complainant’s position that she had\nprivacy settings in place on her Facebook at the time the article was\npublished. However, those settings had made the post visible to many of the\ncomplainant’s Facebook friends, as well as, potentially, the friends of the\nseven people she had “tagged” in her post, one of whom had been a journalist\nfor another publication, who had first brought it to public attention.\nFurthermore, the article had made clear that its report had been based on\ninformation which had been published in the other newspaper: the publication\nhad not sourced the information in a manner which had intruded into the\ncomplainant’s privacy.\n10. Taking account the nature of the information and the\nmanner in which it had been previously circulated, the Committee concluded that\nthe complainant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to\nthis information; nor did its publication in the article under complaint\nrepresent an intrusion into her private life. There was no breach of Clause 2.\n11. The publication had accurately reported the\ncomplainant’s Facebook post; in those circumstances, and where the article had\nmade clear that this information had been sourced from claims made in another\npublication, there was no failure to take care over the accuracy of the\narticle. There was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusion\n12. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial action required13.
