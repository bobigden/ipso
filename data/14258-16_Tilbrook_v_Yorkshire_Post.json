Robin Tilbrook\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Yorkshire\nPost breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Brabin’s ‘bit of a blur’ in Batley”, published in print on\n19 October 2016, and “Batley and Spen candidate Tracy Brabin vows to put\nconstituents before party politics amid ‘bittersweet’ campaign”, published\nonline on 18 October 2016.\n2. The article\nreported on the campaign activities of individuals who were running in the 2016\nBatley and Spen by-election. The article reported that the election was “made\nall the more fraught by the involvement of far-right groups”; it continued by\nreporting that “the English Democrats and the National Front are both fielding\ncandidates”.\n3. The complainant,\nthe chairman of the English Democrats, expressed concern that the article\ncreated the inaccurate impression that the English Democrats were a “far-right”\npolitical party. The complainant said that the English Democrats were a party\nwith a membership originating from across the political spectrum, all of whom\nwere converts to moderate, reasonable and patriotic English nationalism.\n4. The newspaper\ndid not accept any breach of the Code. It said that the English Democrats had\nnot been directly labelled as a far-right organisation, because “far-right\ngroups” and the reference to the English Democrats had been separated by a line\nbreak in the print article. It further said that the inclusion of the English\nDemocrats in the article was in the context of the reporting of wider tensions\nin the Batley and Spen community.\n5. However, the\nnewspaper did provide examples of the activities of the English Democrats and\nindividuals closely associated with it, which it said demonstrated that the\nparty could reasonable be defined as “far-right”. These activities included:\nthe resignation of a high profile figure in the party due to his concern at the\ninflux of new members joining from the British National Party; the references to\nthe English Democrats in the “Hope Not Hate” report which analysed the support\nfor far-right groups in the UK; the complainant’s own assertion that the\nrecruitment of former BNP party members would make the English Democrats more\n“electorally credible”; and third party submissions published on the\ncomplainant’s blog, which expressed extreme nationalist sentiments. It said\nthis information would lead a reasonable person to assess the English Democrats\nas an organisation which appeals to, and represents, the far-right wing of\npolitics. It also noted that the English Democrats had been described as\n“far-right” by other media outlets.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nFindings of the Committee\n7. The Committee\ndid not accept the newspaper’s position that the separation of “far-right\ngroups” and reference to the English Democrats, through use of a line break in\nthe article, meant that the article did not suggest that the English Democrats\nwere a “far-right” political party.\n8. The\ncharacterisation of political speech and parties within the traditional “left”\nand “right” political spectrum is a subjective assessment. In that context, the\nCommittee acknowledged, as was the complainant’s position, that where a\npolitical party is placed on that spectrum, will be a matter of debate.\n9. In this\ninstance, the article referred to the English Democrats as one of the groups\nwho were fielding candidates in the Batley and Spen by-election, against the\nLabour candidate. It juxtaposed these groups with mainstream right wing\nparties, such as the Conservatives and UKIP, who were not fielding a candidate\nin the by-election.\n10. Furthermore, the newspaper had provided sufficient examples,\nof activities and speech associated with the English Democrats in support of\nits characterisation of the party as “far-right”. Given this, and in light of\nthe context in which the reference to the English Democrats was made, the\nCommittee did not consider that the reference to the party was significantly\nmisleading. There was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusions\n11. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\nN/A\nDate complaint received: 20/12/2016Date decision issued: 27/02/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
