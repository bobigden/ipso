It said that the\nmagazine had made “extraordinary allegations that the Duchess of Cambridge\nfound her sister and brother-in-law ‘snogging in a bathroom’ at the royal\nwedding”. It said that the magazine had “breathlessly” claimed that there had\nalways been “sexual tension” between the pair, but now that they were single\nthey were “free to act on their mutual attraction”. The piece concluded by\nstating that the Palace had yet to comment on the claims, “though it may not\nbother” as the US magazine had a “history of ‘revealing’ celebrity couplings\nhotly denied by those involved”.3. The\ncomplainant said that the newspaper had repeated claims made in a US magazine that\nwere “completely untrue”, and that the newspaper had failed to corroborate the\nfacts before publication. He noted that the article had called the claims\n“extraordinary” but considered that it had not asserted categorically that they\nwere false. He argued that the newspaper could not justify the publication of\ninaccurate information simply by attributing it to a third party. As the US\nmagazine was not considered to be a reliable source of information in the US,\nand the newspaper had attached no credence to the claims, it should not have\nrepeated them. In addition, it had republished the magazine’s front page, which\nshowed an image of him that had been doctored to give the appearance that he\nhad been partially clothed on a beach with Ms Middleton; there was no mention\nof the fact that the image had been altered.4. The complainant said that\ndespite the falsity of the claims, the story had concerned private – in\nparticular sexual – information about which he had a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. He did not accept that this expectation had been reduced because the\nclaims had already been published by a magazine with a limited hard-copy\ncirculation in the US. In contrast, this newspaper had circulated the claims in\nthe UK and worldwide, and numerous publications had followed suit. The\ncomplainant requested the removal of the online article and a prominent\napology.5. The\nnewspaper said that its article had made clear that it was not an account of a\nrelationship between the complainant and Ms Middleton; it was a report about an\narticle, which had appeared in a prominent US magazine. It noted that its piece\nhad contained seven references – including in its headline – to the fact that\nthese were claims made by the magazine. It noted that its piece had also said\nthat the magazine had no substantiation for the claims and that they had not\nbeen confirmed or commented on by the complainant’s representatives.6. The newspaper said that Mail\nOnline had covered the story separately, and the website’s journalist had sought\ncomment from the complainant’s representatives before publication. That\nopportunity had not been taken, and this had been reflected in the newspaper’s\narticle. It rejected the complainant’s position that Mail Online had been told\nthat the claims were a “complete fiction”. In fact, the complainant’s\nrepresentative had said that they had not read the US article, but that the\nmagazine “regularly reports complete fiction like this”. Following publication\nof the Mail Online article, a member of the website’s staff had offered to\npublish the Palace’s response to it, but had been told that there were “no\ncircumstances where we would provide comment for a story like that”.7. The newspaper did not consider\nthat it was acceptable for Kensington Palace to dictate what it could report.\nIt said that it was also unacceptable for the Palace to respond to claims by\nissuing denials, which it refused to confirm on the record, thereby making the\ndenials unreportable. Had a denial been issued, the newspaper would have published\nit.8. The newspaper said that it had\nreported claims made by a magazine with a readership of 4.4 million; the\nallegations were clearly already in the public domain. It also argued that the\nfact of a relationship between two unmarried individuals was not private,\nparticularly when one of those individuals was a senior member of the royal\nfamily; the relationship between the complainant and Ms Middleton had been the\nsubject of widespread comment since the royal wedding.9. The newspaper did not accept\nany inaccuracies and therefore it did not consider that an opportunity to reply\nwas required. It said it would be happy, however, to publish a follow-up\narticle or the following wording in the Corrections & Clarifications column\non page two:In common with many other publications\nand global digital news sites, on December 10 we reported that a major American\nmagazine had claimed there was a relationship between Prince Harry and Pippa\nMiddleton. Our article was clearly sceptical about the veracity of the\nmagazine’s claims. We are also happy to make clear that Prince Harry’s\nspokesman has since confirmed for the record there is no truth whatsoever in\nthe magazine’s story. Relevant\nCode provisions10. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement\nor distortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due\nprominence, and - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving\nthe Regulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance.iii) The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Clause 2 (Opportunity to reply)A fair opportunity for reply to inaccuracies must\nbe given when reasonably called for.Clause 3 (Privacy)i)\nEveryone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home,\nhealth and correspondence, including digital communications.ii)\nEditors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private\nlife without consent. Account will be taken of the complainant's own public\ndisclosures of information.Findings\nof the Committee11. These\nwere unsubstantiated claims, which were reported as such. The newspaper had\ntaken care to ensure that the claims were reported with due scepticism. For\ninstance, the first line of the article had said “it all sounds rather too much\nlike a plot dreamed up in a Hollywood movie”; the second line had described the\nclaims as “extraordinary allegations”; and the final line had said that the US\nmagazine had a “history” of reporting claims about celebrity relationships that\nwere “hotly denied”.12. The\nnewspaper had published the article in the knowledge that Kensington Palace had\nno intention of commenting on the story. However, the article had emphasised\nthat the newspaper attached no credence to the claims, and it alerted readers\nto the fact that there were good reasons to doubt their accuracy. In such\ncircumstances, there was no failure to take care over the accuracy of the\narticle in breach of Clause 1(i). The article was not significantly misleading\nin breach of Clause 1(ii).13. It was clear that the “doctored”\nimage formed part of the cover of the US magazine, and where doubt was cast on\nthe truth of its claims, the republication of the cover was not significantly\nmisleading. The complaint under Clause 1 was not upheld.14. The claims made about the\ncomplainant and Ms Middleton had the potential to intrude into his private\nlife. The terms of Clause 3 were engaged,\nregardless of the accuracy of the allegations.15. The article, however, had clearly suggested that the claims were not to be\nbelieved. The fact that the newspaper was clearly dismissive of the\nspeculation, and the tone it had adopted in the piece, diminished any intrusive\neffect that the speculation may have had. Furthermore, the claims had already\nbeen published by a magazine with a circulation of 4.4 million readers. The\nlevel of intrusion did not amount to a breach of Clause 3. The complaint under\nClause 3 was not upheld.16. The\nterms of Clause 2 provide people with the opportunity to reply to published\ninaccuracies. No inaccuracies had been established by the Committee, and\nthe complainant had not requested an opportunity to reply. There was no breach\nof Clause 2.Conclusions17. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.Remedial\naction requiredN/A\nDate complaint received:\n11/12/2015 \nDate decision issued: 25/04/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
