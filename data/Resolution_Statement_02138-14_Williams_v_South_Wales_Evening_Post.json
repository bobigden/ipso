Chris Williams\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the South Wales\nEvening Post breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in\narticles headlined “Family of ‘cannibal killer’ ‘devastated’ by death of victim”,\n“’Cannibal’ ‘eats woman’s face’ in village hotel and dies after police taser\nhim”, and “’Cannibal’ killing victim Cerys Yemm was chatted up by suspected\nmurderer in a bar”, published online on 7 November 2014.\n2. The articles\nreported that Cerys Yemm had met Matthew Williams on a night out and\naccompanied him back to his hostel. They reported that the victim had died\nafter an attack by Mr Williams, which the articles alleged involved acts of\ncannibalism. The articles also included comments from friends and family of the\nvictim, and individuals from the local community.\n3. The complainant\nwas the father of Matthew Williams. He said that it was inaccurate to refer to\nhis son as a “cannibal”, as at the time of publication no cause of death had\nbeen established. The complainant said that reports of a cannibalistic element\nto the attack were based on statements by witnesses and locals, which he\nbelieved were inaccurate.\n4. The complainant\nand publication agreed to put the complaint on hold until after the inquests\nwere complete and the full details of the event were known.\n5. The complainant\nsaid that the inquest had found that cannibalism had not taken place, and\ntherefore it had been inaccurate for the publication to report this when it had\nnot been confirmed as fact.\n6. The newspaper\ndid not accept that it had breached the Code. It said that the article was\nbased on eye witness accounts, including a 999 call heard at the inquest. The\npublication said that the findings of the inquest did not make the article\ninaccurate, as it was published before the findings of the inquest were known;\nhowever they had published subsequent articles reporting the findings of the\ninquests, which made clear that no acts of cannibalism had taken place.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n8. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n9. Following\nIPSO’s intervention, the publication added links to the follow-up articles to\nthe original article so that readers were aware of the outcome of the inquest.\n10. The complainant said that this resolved the matter to\nhis satisfaction.\n11. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 13/11/2014Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 16/06/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
