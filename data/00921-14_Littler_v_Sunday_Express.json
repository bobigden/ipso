Bob Littler complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that the Sunday Express had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Alice killer found dead”,\npublished on 5 October 2014. \n2. The article reported that police had found the body of\nArnis Zalkalns, who was suspected of killing schoolgirl Alice Gross. \n3. The complainant said that the headline was inaccurate, as\nMr Zalkalns had not been tried or convicted of Miss Gross’s murder, and the\nonly evidence available was circumstantial. \n4. The newspaper did not accept that the headline was\nmisleading. It noted the sub-headline, “Latvian suspect discovered in wood less\nthan two miles from murder scene”. Further, a headline inside the edition had\nreferred to Mr Zalkalns as a “suspect”, and he was described on the front page\nas “prime suspect”. The text contained no reference to him as the killer of\nMiss Gross. The article as a whole had made clear that Mr Zalkalns had not been\nconvicted of the murder. Further, there had been extensive coverage of the\ncase, and readers were aware of the fact that, while Mr Zalkalns had not been\nconvicted of Miss Gross’s murder, he was a convicted killer. The headline was\nnot therefore inaccurate or misleading. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \nFindings of the Committee\n6. The newspaper’s defence of the headline, that it was\naccurate because Mr Zalkans was a convicted killer, was not convincing. \n7. However, the Committee noted that it generally considers\nheadlines in context. In this case, the sub-headline had referred to Mr\nZalkalns as a “suspect”. Further, the article had made clear throughout that\nthe investigation into Miss Gross’s death had not yet been concluded. There was\nno breach of Clause 1. \nConclusions\n8. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 06/10/2014 \nDate decision issued: 17/12/2014 \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
