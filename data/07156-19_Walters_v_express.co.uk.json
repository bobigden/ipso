Ailsa Walters complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that express.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Why are Man City fans booing\nLiverpool star James Milner in Vincent Kompany testimonial?”, published on 11\nSeptember 2019.\n2. The article reported that footballer James Milner had\nbeen “booed by a smattering of Manchester City supporters when he touched the\nball during Vincent Kompany’s testimonial.”\n3. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) as Mr Milner did not play at Mr Kompany’s\ntestimonial and it was therefore impossible that he had been booed by fans. She\nalso noted that the match was a testimonial, rather than a competitive match,\nwhich had a large impact on whether he would be jeered as it was for charity.\n4. The publication did not accept that Clause 1 of the Code\nhad been breached, though it accepted that the article was inaccurate. The\narticle had been prewritten, based on previous games in which Mr Milner had\nbeen booed by Manchester City fans. In addition, the publication had relied on\nsocial media claims that Mr Milner had received abuse after leaving the team\nbus. The article had then been accidentally published. The publication had\ntaken steps in order to stop this mistake from reoccurring, by sending a formal\nemail to the journalist in question and a general email to the team to make\nthem aware of the issue and to stop it from happening again. The article had\nbeen removed shortly after publication and the following correction was\npublished after the complaint was referred by IPSO:\nCorrection - Man City fans boo James Milner - 19.09.19\nIn an article headlined 'Why are Man City fans booing\nLiverpool star James Milner in Vincent Kompany testimonial?' and published on\nSeptember 11 2019 we claimed that James Milner was booed by Manchester City\nsupporters when he 'touched the ball during the Vincent Kompany's testimonial.'\nTo clarify, the match was between the Man City Legends and Premier League All\nStars teams. The match was a celebration of Kompany's 11 years at Manchester\nCity and to raise money for the charity 'Tackle 4 MCR' which campaigns to\nsupport homeless people in Manchester. James Milner was expected to appear as he\nwas listed on the team sheet for the 'Man City Legends' though in fact he did\nnot play. He has previously been booed by Manchester City supporters in their\nmatches against Liverpool at the Etihad stadium in March 2017 and again in\nSeptember 2017. In January 2019 he was again booed by Manchester City fans\nduring the match against Liverpool. At the time of the Kompany testimonial\nmatch there were unconfirmed claims on social media that when James Milner had\ngot off the Man City Legends' team bus he had received abuse. Those unconfirmed\nclaims should not have formed the basis of the article and we apologise for\nthat error. We are happy to set the record straight.\n5. The complainant said that the correction was inadequate\nand did not put the correct position on record, as booing on previous occasions\nwas not relevant to the article and therefore not to the correction either.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n7. The publication had reported that Mr Milner had been\nbooed during a football game, despite Mr Milner not having played and not\nhaving been booed. The article had been written in advance of the game and had\nbeen published by mistake. This represented a failure to take care not to\npublish inaccurate information in breach of Clause 1(i).\n8. The entire article centred on Mr Milner being booed\nwhilst playing; this did not occur and therefore the article was significantly\ninaccurate. A correction was required under the terms of Clause 1(ii).\n9. When alerted to the error, the article was removed from\nthe website and the publication had published a correction, which was suitably\nprompt. However, the Committee did not consider that the published correction\nhad clearly identified the inaccuracy being corrected or made the correct\nposition clear in order to satisfy the requirements of Clause 1(ii). The\nwording also contained additional information regarding the reasons for the\nmatch and the previous times Mr Milner had been booed. The inclusion of this\ninformation, which was not required to correct the inaccuracy, further obscured\nthe position. As such, there was a breach of Clause 1(ii).\nConclusions\n10. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1(i) and Clause\n1(ii).\nRemedial Action Required\n11. Having upheld the complaint, the Committee considered what\nremedial action should be required. In circumstances where the Committee\nestablishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the publication of a\ncorrection and/or adjudication. The nature, extent and placement of which is\ndetermined by IPSO.\n12. In circumstances where the publication had promptly\npublished a correction, albeit that the wording was not suitable to satisfy the\nterms of Clause 1 (ii), the Committee considered that the publication of a\nfurther correction in the online corrections page was the appropriate remedy. \n13. The wording should only include information required to\ncorrect the inaccuracy: that the article had been written before the match had\ntaken place and had been published in error; and that the original article had\nreported that Mr Milner had played in the match when he did not, and that he\nhad not therefore been booed. The wording should also state that it has been\npublished following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation. The full wording should be agreed with IPSO in advance.\n \nDate complaint received: 12/09/19\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 30/04/20\n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
