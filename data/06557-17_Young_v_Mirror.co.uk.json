Joel\nYoung complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nMirror.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2 (Privacy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “’Why haven’t you killed\nyourself?’ Ranting TV producer’s vile phone calls to frightened work rival”,\npublished on 20 March 2017.\n2. The\narticle reported that the complainant had admitted to harassing a “work rival”\nand impersonating a police officer, but that he had denied threatening him. It\nsaid that he had telephoned the victim more than 65 times over a\nfive-and-a-half hour period, and that he had impersonated a police officer\nduring the telephone calls. The article also included a recording of one of the\ntelephone calls in which the complainant repeatedly asked the victim why he\n“hasn’t ‘killed himself’”. It reported that in court, the complainant had to be\nreprimanded by an usher “for blowing kisses and winking” towards the victim who\nwas sitting in the public gallery.\n3. The\ncomplainant said that the article was biased against him. He denied that he had\nbeen warned by the usher for winking and blowing kisses at the victim. He had\nmerely been asked not to look at the public gallery as the victim walked in.\nFurthermore, the piece had failed to report his account of the victim’s\nconduct. In addition, the article had inaccurately reported that he was 40,\nrather than 30.4. The\ncomplainant was also concerned that the newspaper had published a recording of\none of his telephone calls with the victim without his consent. He had been\nunaware that he was being recorded and the recording had not been heard in\ncourt because he had admitted to his actions at the first opportunity. In\naddition, he said that the newspaper had published images of him which it had\ntaken from his social media accounts without his consent and in breach of\ncopyright.\n5. The\nnewspaper said that the article was an accurate report of court proceedings,\nand the information it had chosen to include was a matter of editorial\ndiscretion.\n6. The\nnewspaper said that the reporter had attended the court proceedings, and he had\nconfirmed that before the magistrates had entered the court room, the\ncomplainant had been reprimanded for winking and blowing kisses at the victim.\nIt did not consider that it was misleading that the article had not included\nthe complainant’s account of the victim’s conduct.\n7. The\nnewspaper did not consider that it was significant whether the complainant was\n30 or 40 years old, but given the concerns raised, it offered to amend this in\nthe article.\n8. The\nnewspaper said that the recording had shown the complainant making one of the\n65 phone calls for which he was convicted. Although the recording of the phone\ncall was not heard in court, it had formed part of the behaviour for which the\ncomplainant was convicted. The newspaper did not consider that the complainant\nhad a reasonable expectation of privacy over behaviour of this kind; the\npublication of the recording was justified in the public interest.\n9. With\nregards to the photographs, the newspaper said that the images had been taken\nfrom the complainant’s open Facebook account, which remained accessible to the\npublic. It did not consider that the images had shown the complainant engaged\nin a private activity, nor had they revealed any private information about him.\nRelevant Code provisions\n10. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nFindings of the Committee\n11. There was\na dispute between the parties as to whether the complainant had been\nreprimanded for “blowing kisses and winking” towards the victim who was in the\npublic gallery of the court room, and the Committee was unable to reconcile the\ndiffering positions. However, it was accepted that before the proceedings\nbegan, the complainant had been asked by the court usher not to look at the\npublic gallery where the victim was seated. In the full context of the article,\nwhich accurately reported that the complainant had pleaded guilty to harassment\nand which detailed the nature of his offence, the Committee did not consider\nthat the reason for the request, as reported in the article, was significantly\nmisleading. Furthermore, the Editors’ Code does not contain a requirement for\nimpartiality. The newspaper was not obliged to report the complainant’s account\nof the victim’s conduct. These points did not raise a breach of Clause 1. \n12. It was\naccepted that the complainant’s age had been inaccurately reported. The\nCommittee welcomed the newspaper’s offer to amend the online article\naccordingly, but this was not a significant point that required correction\nunder the terms of Clause 1.\n13. The\nrecording of the complainant’s telephone call to the victim had not been heard\nin court, and the complainant had not consented to its publication. However,\nthe Committee did not consider that the complainant had a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy regarding a recording of part of the course of conduct\nfor which he was later convicted in open court. There was no breach of Clause 2\non this point.\n14. The\nnewspaper had published images taken from the complainant’s Facebook page,\nwhich showed his face. He was not engaged in a private activity in the\nphotographs, and their publication had not disclosed private information about\nhim. Furthermore, copyright is a legal matter and therefore concerns in this\nregard are not for consideration under the Code. There was no breach of Clause\n2.\nConclusion\n15. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.Remedial Action RequiredN/A\nDate complaint received: 25/04/2017Date decision issued: 04/07/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
