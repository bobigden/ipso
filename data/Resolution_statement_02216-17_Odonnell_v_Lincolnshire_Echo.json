Miss Odonnell\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Lincolnshire\nEcho breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 12 (Discrimination) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Coffee shop in Lincoln\ncloses for refurb”, published on 22 March 2017.\n2. The article\nreported that a coffee shop in Lincoln was closed for refurbishment, and would\nbe reopening at the start of Easter. The complainant said that the article\ncontained inaccurate information about her and about comments she had made\nabout the coffee shop.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n3. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\n(i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\n(ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\n(iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant\ninaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for.\n(iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign,\nmust distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\n(v) A publication must report fairly and accurately the\noutcome of an action for defamation to which it has been a party, unless an\nagreed settlement states otherwise, or an agreed statement is published.\nClause 12 (Discrimination)\n(i) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference\nto an individual's, race, colour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual\norientation or to any physical or mental illness or disability.\n(ii) Details of an individual's race, colour, religion,\ngender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability\nmust be avoided unless genuinely relevant to the story.\nMediated outcome\n4. The complaint\nwas not resolved through correspondence between the parties. IPSO therefore\nbegan an investigation into the matter.\n5. In order to\nresolve the complaint, the publication offered to remove the online article.\n6. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to her satisfaction.\n7. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 22/03/2017Date complaint concluded by by IPSO: 16/05/2017 \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
