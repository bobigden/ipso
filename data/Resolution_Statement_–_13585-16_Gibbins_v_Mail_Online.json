Angela Gibbins complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that Mail Online breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “British Council launches\ndisciplinary action against manager paid £80k to promote the UK abroad who\nslated ‘f*****g d******d’ Prince George as an example of ‘white privilege’ on\nFacebook”, published on 26 July 2016.\n2. The article reported that the complainant “faces\ndisciplinary proceedings today after she launched a vile Facebook attack on\nPrince George under a post calling him a ‘f******* d*****d’”.\n3. The complainant said that another Facebook user had\nposted a meme on Facebook. A meme is an image, often accompanied by a short\namount of text, which is easily shared on social media.  In this case, the meme consisted of an image\nof Prince George accompanied by the words “I know he’s only two years old, but\nPrince George already looks like a fucking dickhead”. The complainant said that\nshe had made comments about children and privilege in a sub-thread conversation\nwith friends. However, she said she had not referred to Prince George as\n“looking like a fucking dickhead”. She said that the article left readers in no\ndoubt that she had done so, which was inaccurate.\n4. The publication said that the article accurately\nreported that the complainant had commented under the meme, and did not claim\nthat the complainant had said that Prince George “looked like a fucking\ndickhead”. It offered to amend the article to further clarify the position on\nthis point, and to add a clarification as a footnote.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant\ninaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign,\nmust distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nMediated Outcome\n6. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n7. Following IPSO’s intervention, the publication offered\nto remove the article, delete internally held copies of a photograph\naccompanying the articles, and to publish the following clarification, linked\nto the news homepage for 24 hours:\nAngela Gibbins\nFollowing the publication of an article on 26 July 2016\nheadlined ‘British Council launches disciplinary action against manager paid\n£80k to promote the UK abroad who slated ‘f*****g d******d Prince George as an\nexample of ‘white privilege’ on Facebook’, we have been asked to clarify that\nAngela Gibbins did not post any comments relating to the photograph of Prince\nGeorge. Ms Gibbins commented underneath the photograph, which was posted on the\nFacebook page of the band Dub Pistols, and her comments were made as part of a\nsub-thread discussion about children and privilege. Ms Gibbins did not make the\nf*****g d******d comment in relation to Prince George. We are happy to clarify\nand apologise for any confusion caused.\n8. The complainant said that this resolved her complaint\nto IPSO under Clause 1.\n9. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints\nCommittee did not make a determination as to whether there had been any breach\nof the Code.\nDate complaint received: 24/11/2016\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 06/03/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
