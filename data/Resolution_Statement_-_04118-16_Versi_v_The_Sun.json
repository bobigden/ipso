The article was also published online with the\nheadline “Mum-of-four butchered while caring for her young kids as cops probe Islamic\nhonour killing lead”. 2.    The article reported that it was feared that a\nwoman killed in her own home may have been the victim of an “Islamic honour\nattack”. It reported that cops were “open-minded” about the motive for the\nattack but were “probing the possibility [the deceased] was targeted in honour\nbased violence”. 3.    The complainant said that the reference in the\nheadline to an “Islamic honour killing” was inaccurate: “honour killings” have\nno basis in Islam. He said that “honour killings” are rooted in culture, not\nreligion. 4.    The newspaper acknowledged that most Muslims\nbelieve that there is nothing in the Quran that suggests killing a woman in the\nname of ‘honour’ is acceptable, and it recognised that so-called\n“honour-killings” take place in communities other than Muslim communities.\nHowever, it said that certain individuals have interpreted Islam in a way which\nleads them to commit these crimes in the name of their religion. It denied that\n‘religion’ and ‘culture’ could be distinguished in the manner the complainant\nhad sought to.  \nRelevant Code Provisions 5.    Clause 1 (Accuracy) i)  The Press\nmust take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or\nimages, including headlines not supported by the text. ii) A significant\ninaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and\nwith due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In cases\ninvolving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator. iii)   A fair\nopportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for. iv)   The Press,\nwhile free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between\ncomment, conjecture and fact. \nMediated Outcome 6.    The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter. 7.    Following IPSO’s intervention, the newspaper offered\nto publish the following correction in its Corrections and Clarifications box\non page 2 of the newspaper: \n“An\narticle “Honour Killing of Mum”, 26 May, said that the police were\ninvestigating whether Mrs Khan may have been murdered in an ‘Islamic honour\nkilling’. We are happy to make clear Islam as a religion does no support\nso-called ‘honour killings’.” It offered to replace the words “Islamic honour\nkilling” in the headline to the online article with the words “honour killing”\nin inverted commas. It offered to publish the following footnote on the online\narticle:  \n“An\nearlier version of this article said that the police were investigating whether\nMrs Khan may have been murdered in an ‘Islamic honour killing’. We are happy to\nmake clear Islam as a religion does no support so-called ‘honour killings’.” 8.    In addition, and on the complainant’s suggestion,\nthe newspaper offered to meet with him to discuss his complaint and other\nissues. Following this meeting, the complainant said that the action offered by\nthe newspaper would resolve his complaint to his satisfaction. 9.    As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code. \nDate complaint received: 24/06/2016\nDate complaints concluded by IPSO: 17/08/2016\n \n \n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
