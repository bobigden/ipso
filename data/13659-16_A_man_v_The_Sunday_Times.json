A man complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The Sunday\nTimes breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice. \n2. The article\nreported on the current activities of individuals who it said had been\nassociated with the “Trojan Horse” allegations in state schools in Birmingham.\nThe article referred to a school, which had been placed in special\nmeasures following a report into the “Trojan Horse” allegations, published in\n2014. It described the complainant, who had been a governor at the school, as a “figure who helped run a Trojan Horse school”. The article\nreported that the complainant had been subsequently “removed” from his post at\nthe school. It also reported that the complainant had applied to be a Labour\nCouncil candidate in the 2018 Birmingham City Council election, but had\nsubsequently “dropped the application”.\n3. The article appeared\nin substantially the same form online.\n4. The complainant\nexpressed concern that by describing him as a “figure who helped run a Trojan\nHorse school”, the newspaper had created the inaccurate impression that he had\nbeen identified in the 2014 report. Whilst the complainant did not dispute that\nhe had been a governor at the school, he said that the article had\ncreated the inaccurate impression that he had been running the school alone,\nrather than as part of a broad governing body. Further, the complainant said\nthat he had not been “removed” from his post; he was no longer a governor\nbecause the governing body had been disbanded.\n5. The complainant\ndenied that he had ever made an application to be a Labour Council candidate in\nthe Council elections. The complainant said that he had submitted a three-month\nactivity diary, which appeared on the 2018 Birmingham City Council election\nwebsite. The complainant said that he was a constituency Labour Party Secretary\nwho was responsible for signing off members’ activity diaries, and it was in\nthat capacity that he had submitted his activity diaries. He said that he had\ndone so to set an example of what was expected from candidates who wanted to\ncomplete an application to be a Labour Council candidate in the 2018 Birmingham\nCity Council election.\n6. The complainant\nsaid that although submitting an activity diary was a requirement in the\napplication process, this requirement was one part of a longer application\nform. On that basis, the complainant said that the completion of the activity\ndiary did not amount to an application to be a Labour Council candidate in the\n2018 Birmingham City Council election, and that he had not “dropped” an\napplication because he had never submitted one.\n7. The newspaper\ndid not accept any breach of the Code. It said that the article did not state\nthat the complainant had been identified in the 2014 report, and it made the\ncomplainant’s position as a governor at the school clear. It said that the\ngoverning body of a school provides strategic management, sets budgets and\nappoints and dismisses senior teaching staff, and therefore governors can be\nconsidered as “helping to run” their school.\n8. The newspaper\nsaid that the complainant had been removed as a governor of the school, along with the rest of the governing body, in the wake of the “Trojan\nHorse” allegations and the school’s placement into special measures. It also\nnoted that the complainant had been described as having been “removed” as a governor\nby other media outlets.\n9. The newspaper\nsaid that the complainant’s name appeared on a list entitled “Applicants” on an\nofficial Labour Party document, which was publicly available. The complainant’s\nname featured his activity diaries which detailed his campaigning activity from\nJanuary 2016 to March 2016. The newspaper said that the application process to\nbe a Labour Council candidate involved two stages. The first stage was for the\ncandidate to put their name on the list of applicants and to submit campaign\nactivity diaries from 1 January 2016 onwards. The second stage was to fill out\nan application form and pay a Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check. The\nnewspaper said that the inclusion of the complainant’s name in the list of applicants,\nalongside an activity diary beginning in January 2016, showed that the\ncomplainant had begun the application process.\n10. The newspaper said that, given that the activity diary\nended in March, this showed that the complainant had “dropped” his application\nat that point.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n11. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni. The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii. A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii. A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\nFindings of the Complaints Committee\n12. It was not in dispute that the complainant had been a\ngovernor at a school which had been put under special measures following the\n“Trojan Horse” allegations. In those circumstances, it was not inaccurate to\ndescribe the complainant as a “figure who helped run a Trojan Horse school”;\nthe article had set out that he had been a governor. The Committee did not\naccept that by reporting this, the newspaper had suggested that the complainant\nhad run the school alone, or had been named in the 2014 “Trojan\nHorse” report. There was no breach of the Code on this point.\n13. The Committee did not consider that it was significantly\ninaccurate for the newspaper to say that the complainant had been “removed”\nfrom his position, given that he accepted that the school’s governing body had\nbeen disbanded following the “Trojan Horse” report and the school being placed\ninto special measures. There was no breach of the Code on this point.\n14. The Committee noted the complainant’s position that he\nhad not completed an application to be a Labour Council candidate in the 2018\nBirmingham City Council election. However, the complainant’s name appeared as\none of many names on a list, all of whom were making an application to be a\ncandidate. This list was entitled “Applicants” and was published on the Labour\nParty website entitled “City Council Election 2018”. The Committee noted the\ncomplainant’s position that he had submitted his activity diaries as an\n“example”; however, the complainant’s diary was not identified as such in the\nlist or on the website. In circumstances where the newspaper had provided\nevidence that the complainant had undertaken the early stages of an application\nto be a Birmingham City Councillor, it was not inaccurate or misleading to\nrefer to him as having applied, when the article made clear that the process\nhad been discontinued. There was no failure to take care over the accuracy of\nthe article on this point, and it was not inaccurate to characterise the fact\nhe had not continued with the application process, as “dropping” the\napplication. There was no breach of the Code.\nConclusion\n15. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial Action RequiredN/A\nDate complaint received: 27/11/2016Date decision issued: 20/02/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
