It stated that: “Several high profile Stonewall founders\nset up the LGB Alliance (note the missing T) a couple of years back because\nthey thought the organisation had mislaid its original mission in favour of a\nvocal trans lobby.”\n3.\nThe article also appeared online in substantially the same format.\n4.\nThe complainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. He\nsaid that the two founders of the LGB Alliance had not been founders of\nStonewall. He considered that the error had been included to intentionally\nmisrepresent the LGB Alliance’s origins in an attempt to legitimise it. He\nnoted that, when he had raised the inaccuracy in the comments section below the\narticle, instead of retracting the error, the journalist had written that the\nLGB alliance “was, in fact, set up by founding members of Stonewall” and that\none of the Stonewall founders “was a principal speaker at the [LGB Alliance’s]\ninaugural meeting”. The complainant interpreted these comments as the\njournalist being aware at the time of their response that her statement as\noriginally published was false. The complainant said he had attempted to\ncomplain to the publication directly via its complaints process but had not\nreceived a response.  \n5.\nThe publication accepted that the statement under complaint was inaccurate and\napologised for not receiving the complainant’s email. It said that it was a\nmistake, which should have been picked up by the sub-editors, to refer to\n“several” Stonewall founders, where it was only a single Stonewall founder\ninvolved in LGB Alliance. In addition, it accepted that the Stonewall founder\nhad not “set up” the LGB Alliance but had spoken at its inaugural meeting. The\nonline article had been amended, prior to IPSO receiving the complaint, to\nreport that: “A high-profile Stonewall founder helped set up the LGB Alliance”.\nOn receipt of the complaint from IPSO, the publication offered to publish a\ncorrection. After further correspondence with the complainant, it amended the\nproposed wording to the following:\nA\ncolumn in the Seven Days section of the Sunday National by Ruth Wishart on\nAugust 15, 2021, headlined \"Why is a trans minority being pandered to by\nthe Scottish Government\", said: \"Several high profile Stonewall\nfounders set up the LGB Alliance.\"  \nThis\nwas not accurate – it should have read: “A high-profile Stonewall founder spoke\nat the launch of the LGB Alliance (note the ­missing T) a couple of years back\nbecause he thought the organisation had mislaid its original mission in favour\nof a vocal trans lobby.”\nIt\noffered to publish the correction in print in its established corrections\ncolumn on the letters page, and at the top of the article online. The original\narticle had appeared in print on page six. The publication said that the\nStonewall founder had made numerous media appearances, and could therefore be\nregarded as “high-profile”. The publication also said that the comments made by\nthe journalist in the readers’ comments section demonstrated that she was not\naware that the assertion that multiple Stonewall founders had set up the LGB\nAlliance was inaccurate, as she had publicly defended the mistake.\n6.\nThe complainant said the correction was still inaccurate. He said that the\nStonewall founder referred to could not be described as a “high profile\nStonewall founder” as this phrasing implied the founder had appeared frequently\nin the media in his capacity as a Stonewall founder, which the complainant did\nnot consider to be accurate. The complainant further said it was misleading to\ninclude the link to Stonewall at all as it gave the impression that the LGB\nAlliance was a splinter group from Stonewall, and validated their position.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause\n1 (Accuracy)\ni)\nThe Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii)\nA significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii)\nA fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv)\nThe Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n7.\nThe newspaper had accepted that it was inaccurate to report that “Several high\nprofile Stonewall founders set up the LGB Alliance”, when in fact one founder\nhad spoken at the LBG Alliance’s initial meeting. It acknowledged that the\nerror should have been identified during the editing process. The Committee\nfound the inaccuracy amounted to a clear breach of Clause 1(i), and, where the\nstatement suggested a significantly stronger link between the two organisations\nthan was the case – claiming that more than one person was involved, and overstating\nthe role of that person in the setting up of the LGB Alliance –this was a\nsignificant inaccuracy that required correction under Clause 1(ii).\n8.\nThe Committee then considered whether the correction supplied by the\npublication was sufficient under Clause 1(ii). The correction both identified\nthe original inaccuracy and put the correct position on record, stating that it\nwas a single founder who had been involved in the LGB Alliance and setting out\nthe extent of his involvement at the new organisation – namely, that he had\nspoken at its inaugural meeting. Considering the founder’s multiple appearances\non television and in the media, the Committee did not consider it significantly\ninaccurate to describe him as a “high profile Stonewall founder”, where he\ncould be characterised as being high profile and was a Stonewall founder. The\narticle had been amended prior to IPSO referring the matter to the publication,\nand a correction was offered in the publication’s first substantive reply,\nwhich represented due promptness, subject to changes requested by the\ncomplainant. The correction was offered in the newspaper’s established\ncorrections and clarifications column and at the start of the online article,\nwhich represented due prominence. There was no breach of Clause 1(ii).\nConclusion(s)\n9.\nThe complaint was upheld under Clause 1(i).\nRemedial\nAction Required\n10.\nThe correction which was offered clearly put the correct position on record,\nand was offered promptly and with due prominence, and should now be published.\nDate\ncomplaint received: 17/08/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 05/01/2022\n \nIndependent\nComplaints Reviewer\nThe\ncomplainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process\nfollowed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent Complaints\nReviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold the request\nfor review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
