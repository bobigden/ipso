Paul Hoyte\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Sunday Mercury\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) in an article headlined “JLR worker given £20,000\naward for ‘injured feelings’”, published in print on 28 May 2017.\n2. The article\nreported that the complainant had been an employee at Jaguar Land Rover Ltd,\nand had brought legal claims against his former employer for unfair dismissal,\non the grounds of race and disability discrimination and\nharassment because of his race. The\narticle stated that the claimant alleged that racist comments had been made in\nrelation to a workplace poster, which the article reported aimed to “discourage\nworkers from taking part in 'disruptive behaviour'.” The article stated that the\nposter “featured a tree full of healthy apples with a rotten one in the middle”\nand carried the caption “don’t let one bad apple spoil it for everyone.” The\narticle also reported that the complainant had complained that racist nicknames\nhad been used in the workplace, and also stated that he had brought a\ndiscrimination claim, and had accused workers of harassing him because of his\ndisability. The article reported that the complainant had won his claims for\ndisability discrimination and harassment and had been awarded nearly £20,000,\nbut claims for unfair dismissal and race discrimination were rejected. The\narticle also stated that the complainant’s claim for costs had been rejected.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that the article was inaccurate. He said that the tribunal had accepted\nhis claim of racial discrimination, and this represented the majority of the\ncompensation he was awarded. He also said he had made allegations of disability\ndiscrimination and harassment against his manager, not fellow workers, that the\nposter in question was not to do with difficult workers, but a whistleblowing\nhotline, and that his employer had made an application for costs, which had\nbeen refused, not him. The complainant was also concerned that the article did\nnot make clear that the company’s internal procedures had been criticised by\nthe tribunal judge.\n4. The newspaper said\nthat the article was based on information heard during proceedings and the\njudgment published by the tribunal. The newspaper did not believe that the\ncomplainant’s concerns relating to the purpose of the workplace poster; that\nthe complainant believed his manager had discriminated and harassed him because\nof his disability; and that the article excluded the tribunal’s criticism of\nthe employer’s internal procedures; represented significant inaccuracies such\nas to require correction under the terms of Clause 1 (ii).\n5. The newspaper said\nthat the summary on the first page of the tribunal’s judgment stated that only\nclaims for harassment on the grounds of race and disability and disability\ndiscrimination had been upheld. However the full judgment, which the newspaper\nhad relied on at several points in the article, made clear that the\ncomplainant’s race discrimination claim had also been upheld. The newspaper\nalso accepted that it had erroneously reported that the complainant had applied\nfor costs, when in fact the application had been made by his employer. The\npublication offered to publish the following correction on page 2 to reflect this:\nOn 28 May 2017(“JLR Worker given £20,000 award ‘injured\nfeelings’”) we reported that “Mr Hoyte had won his claims for disability\ndiscrimination and harassment, but claims for unfair dismissal and race\ndiscrimination were rejected.” We would like to make clear that while Mr\nHoyte’s claim for unfair dismissal was rejected, he won his claims for race\ndiscrimination and disability harassment. We also reported that Mr Hoyte’s\nclaim for costs was rejected and would like to clarify that Mr Hoyte made no\nclaim for costs - it was the respondent’s claim for costs that was refused.\n6. The complainant did not accept the correction offered.\nRelevant Code provisions\n7. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nFindings of the Committee\n8. The summary on the first page of the employment\ntribunal’s judgment had omitted that the complainant’s claim for race\ndiscrimination was also upheld. However, the article had gone further than to\nomit the complainant’s race discrimination claim, but had reported that it had\nbeen rejected by the tribunal. The article also reported that the complainant\nhad applied for costs that had been rejected, when in fact his employer’s\napplication for costs had been rejected. The full judgment, which the newspaper\nwas in possession of, made clear that the complainant’s claim of race\ndiscrimination was upheld, and that his employer had applied for costs and this\nhad been rejected. In this respect, the newspaper had failed to take care not\nto publish inaccurate information, in breach of Clause 1 (i).\n9. It was significantly inaccurate for the article to report\nthat the complainant’s claim for race discrimination was not upheld, as this\nwas the grounds on which the majority of the compensation was awarded.\nSimilarly, it was significantly inaccurate to report that the complainant’s\napplication for costs was refused, as this was an inaccurate report of the\ntribunal’s findings. In this respect, the newspaper had failed to take care not\nto publish inaccurate information, in breach of Clause 1 (i).\n10. The Committee also noted the complainant’s concern that\nthe article had not made clear that his disability harassment claim was brought\nagainst his manager. The Committee did not find this to be significant, as the\nidentity of the employees who the complainant accused of disability harassment\ndid not appear to have a bearing on the decision of the tribunal, and were not\ndirectly referenced in its findings.\n11. The poster advertised a whistleblowing hotline. The\narticle had accurately described what was depicted in the workplace poster and\nreported the complainant’s concern that his colleagues had made racist comments\nin relation to the “bad apple” campaign shown in the poster. In the context of\nan article reporting on the complainant’s employment tribunal, it was not\nmisleading to characterise the poster as seeking to “discourage workers from\ntaking part in disruptive behaviour.” In addition, the newspaper’s decision not\nto include the tribunal’s criticism of the employer’s internal procedures was a\nmatter of selection, over which the newspaper has editorial discretion. The\nomission of this information did not render the article inaccurate or otherwise\nmisleading.\nConclusion\n12. The complaint was upheld in relation to Clause 1 (i).\nRemedial action required\n13. Having upheld the complaint, the Committee considered\nwhat remedial action should be required.\n14. The newspaper had promptly offered to publish a\ncorrection on page two, which addressed the inaccuracies and was sufficiently\nprominent. This should now be published.Date complaint received: 06/06/2017Date decision issued: 01/09/2017  \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
