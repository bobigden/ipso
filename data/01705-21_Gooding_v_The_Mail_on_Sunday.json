Keith Gooding complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that The Mail on Sunday breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “The day anthrax was\nreleased in a tunnel on the Northern Line - by scientists from Porton Down”,\npublished on 7 February 2021.\n2. The article reported on a “secret experiment” in which a\npowder puff which contained spores was thrown onto the tracks of the Northern\nline. The headline of the article described the spores as “anthrax”, whereas\nthe body of the article called them “freeze dried spores from the anthrax\nfamily, B globigii bacteria” and also a “bacteria that mimicked anthrax”. The\narticle reported that B globigii bacteria “can cause eye infections, food poisoning\nand, more serious still, septicaemia”.\n3. The article also appeared online under the headline “The\nday anthrax was released in a tunnel on the Northern Line - by scientists from\nPorton Down... and as ex-MP NORMAN BAKER reveals, it's far from the only time\nthey've used Britons as guinea pigs for experiments” in substantially the same\nformat.\n4. The complainant said that the headline of the article was\ninaccurate in breach of Clause 1. The substance released was not B anthracis,\nwhich causes the bacterial infection known as anthrax, but a bacterium known at\nthe time as “B globigii”, which was then thought to be completely harmless.\nAlthough technically in the same biological family as B anthracis (“anthrax”) –\nthe Bacillaceae family – the majority of the bacteria in this family were not\ntoxic, unlike “anthrax”. The two bacteria (along with many other species) also\nshared the same genus; however, pathogenicity was not the basis of their\nclassification together, but rather the fact that they both formed spores. It\nwas therefore inaccurate and misleading to state that “anthrax” had been\nreleased. The complainant was concerned that the headline would cause alarm, as\nit implied that the government had tried to poison members of the public with a\nvery dangerous pathogen, when it had in fact used what was thought to be a\nharmless substance. This was particularly irresponsible at a time when\nconspiracy theories about the government, COVID-19 and vaccinations were in\ncirculation.\n5. The publication did not accept a breach of the Editors’\nCode. It said that as B globigii is a human pathogen which is “a member of the\nanthrax family”, B anthracis and B globigii were not necessarily two distinctly\ndifferent things. It noted that B globigii could cause serious health issues,\nsuch as eye infections, food poisoning and septicaemia, and maintained that it\nwas not misleading to refer to it as “anthrax” in the headline of the article.\nWhilst the publication did not accept a breach of the Code it offered to amend\nthe online headline and publish the following in its established corrections\nand clarifications box, and as a footnote to the online article:\nA headline published on 7 Feb reported that scientists had\nreleased anthrax on the Northern Line. In fact, as the article made clear, it\nwas B globigii, a bacteria from the anthrax family, that was released during\nthe 1963 experiment.\n6. The complainant said that it may not be appropriate to\nrefer to B globigii as belonging to the “anthrax family” – there was no\nbiological classification “anthrax family”, and there were many other bacteria\nwithin the same family as anthrax, most of which were harmless.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n7. The headline had stated that “anthrax” had been released\nduring an experiment. However, it was not B anthracis, the bacteria that causes\nanthrax, but another bacteria, B globigii, that was released. The text of the\narticle made clear that the bacteria was B globigii, and therefore the question\nfor the Committee was whether the headline was supported by the text.\n8. The publication had said that the headline was supported\nas B globigii and “anthrax” were members of the same family and not necessarily\ndistinct. However, whilst it was accepted by the complainant that both bacteria\nwere part of the Bacillaceae family, they were two distinct types of bacteria\nwhich resulted in different effects in humans. The headline was therefore\nmisleading as to the substance involved because it referred only to “anthrax”,\nwhich the Committee considered implied B anthracis rather than B globigii. The\nCommittee found, therefore, that the headline was misleading, and was not\nsupported by the text in breach of Clause 1(i). As the headline of the article\nmisleadingly implied that a substance which was known to be more dangerous had been\nreleased, this was significant and required correction under Clause 1(ii).\n9. The publication had offered a clarification to be\npublished as a footnote to the online article and in print. However, the\nclarification did not make clear the full position, that “anthrax” (B\nanthracis) and B globigii are two distinct bacteria. In addition, it was not of\ndue prominence for the clarification to be a footnote to the article in\ncircumstances where the misleading information about the type of bacteria which\nhad been released had appeared prominently in the headline and related to a\nmatter concerning public health. On this basis, the proposed clarification did\nnot meet the requirements of Clause 1(ii) resulting in a further breach.\nConclusions\n10. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1.\nRemedial Action Required\n11. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1, the Committee\nconsidered what remedial action should be required. In circumstances where the\nCommittee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the\npublication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of\nwhich is determined by IPSO.\n12. The Committee considered that the publication did not\ntake the necessary care when it described B globigii as “anthrax” in the\nheadline of the article. The Committee considered that the appropriate remedy\nwas the publication of a correction to put the correct position on record. A\ncorrection was considered to be sufficient, as the text of the article had made\nclear that the substance was B globigii.\n13. The Committee then considered the placement of this\ncorrection. This correction should be added to the article and appear as a\nstandalone correction in the online corrections and clarifications column, as\nwell as the print corrections and clarifications column. This wording should\nonly include information required to correct the inaccuracy: that it was not\nanthrax released in the experiment, but B globigii. The wording should also be\nagreed with IPSO in advance and should make clear that it has been published\nfollowing an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation. If\nthe publication intends to continue to publish the online article without\namendment, the correction on the article should be published beneath the\nheadline. If the article is amended, the correction should be published as a\nfootnote which explains the amendments that have been made.\n\nDate complaint received: 15/02/2021\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 02/06/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
