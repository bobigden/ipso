Miqdaad\nVersi complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that express.co.uk\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined \"TERROR ATTACK ON MUSLIMS: Six dead as gunmen ‘shout Allahu\nAkbar’ in Sunday prayer attack”, published on 30 January 2017.\n2. The\narticle reported on a live breaking news story at a Quebec City mosque in which\nsix people were killed and eight wounded following a shooting incident. The\narticle reported that “speaking to Radio Canada, a witness said two masked\nindividuals entered the mosque during prayers on Sunday evening. It seemed to\nme that they had a Quebecois accent. They started to fire, and as they shot\nthey yelled, ‘Allahu Akbar!’”.\n3. The\narticle was amended following the attack, to reflect the developing story. The\nsubheadline reported that ‘A FRENCH-CANADIAN student has become the sole\nsuspect in a shooting in a Quebec City mosque in which six people were killed\nand eight wounded in a horrific incident described by Canada’s prime minister\nas a “terrorist attack on Muslims”.\n4. The\ncomplainant expressed concern that, given that the article had been amended to\nreport that a sole gunman had been charged in the incident, the article’s\nheadline inaccurately reported that “gunmen” had been involved. He further said\nthat the article’s headline became inaccurate because it reported the witness’\ntestimony which was now in dispute, once it had been determined that one gunman\nhad been charged.\n5. The\nnewspaper said that the article was a breaking news story and was accurate at\nthe point of publication. It said that the original version of the article\nreported an initial statement given to Radio Canada from a witness who had\nclaimed gunmen had attacked the mosque and shouted ‘Allahu Akbar’.\n6. The\nnewspaper said that the article was then subject to multiple changes in order\nto reflect the ‘breaking’ nature of the story. Whilst the newspaper accepted\nthat the headline became inaccurate once it had been determined that the\nFrench-Canadian student became the sole suspect in the shooting, it did not\naccept that the failure to update the headline amounted to a significant\ninaccuracy.\n7. It\nfurther said that two follow up articles were subsequently published online\nabout the attack, which both accurately set out the events preceding the sole gunman\nbeing charged. Further, the newspaper removed the article along with social\nmedia posts relating to it.\n8. The\ncomplainant said that these actions did not resolve the complainant to his\nsatisfaction and requested that the newspaper also publish an acknowledgment of\nthe error and an apology.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n9. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni. The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii. A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii. A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\nFindings of the Complaints Committee\n10. The\nCommittee acknowledged that the requirement to take care under the terms of\nClause 1(i) is dependent on context, and in this instance, will reflect the\nparticular challenges of reporting breaking news stories.\n11. It was\naccepted that, contrary to the witness’ account, only one gunman had been\ninvolved. The website had made a series of amendments in an effort to reflect\nmore accurately this position, as facts later emerged. This included an\namendment to the sub-headline which made clear the correct position that a\nFrench-Canadian student had become the sole suspect in the shooting. It was\nthis subsequent version of the article which the Committee was asked to\nconsider.\n12. The\nCommittee noted that the headline had not been amended to reflect the fact that\none gunman had been involved. However, in light of the content of the\nsub-headline, and in the context of a breaking news story, the failure to amend\nthe headline did not amount to a failure to take care not to publish inaccurate\ninformation. The Committee did not consider that a discrepancy relating to the\nnumber of gunmen involved, was significant. There was no breach of Clause 1.\n13. Whilst the\nCommittee did not find a breach of the Code, it welcomed the website’s decision\nto publish follow up articles which made the correct position clear.\nConclusion\n14. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\nN/ADate complaint received: 30/01/2017Date decision issued: 04/05/2017  \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
