    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution Statement 16892-17 Molloy v The Times\n1. Anthony Molloy,\non behalf of the Labour Land Campaign (LLC), complained to the Independent\nPress Standards Organisation that The Times breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in relation to an article headlined “Tax on land ‘would\nslash house prices’”, published on 30 May 2017.\n2. The article\nreported that the Labour party manifesto for the 2017 general election, had\noutlined that the party would consider introducing a land-value tax (LVT), and\nreported claims that the proposal “could treble the bills of English households\nand cause house prices to plummet”. The article reported that the Conservative\nparty had released an analysis of the proposals which had been published by the\nLLC, and claimed that Jeremy had endorsed the LLC in 2015.\n3. The article\nreported the LLC’s proposal to introduce LVT at a “0.85 per cent levy, rising\nto 3 per cent over a ten to 20-year transition period, on the value of land for\nowner-occupied residential properties”. The article claimed that the LLC had\nsaid that “an important side-effect of introducing an LVT was that it would\ncause the market price of land, and therefore houses, to fall, which it\ndescribed as a “long-term benefit”. The article also reported that the\nConservative party analysis said that the 3% levy would result in a\nyearly tax bill of £3,837 for an average family home in England, more than\ntreble the current average council tax bill in 2017-18 of £1,185. The 0.85% introductory rate would result in a bill of £1,087.\n4. The complainant\nsaid that it was inaccurate to report that house prices would “plummet” as a\nresult of the introduction of LVT; he said that the LLC research paper referred\nto in the article reported that “owner-occupied residential property prices on\naverage would not decline”. The complainant said that this research paper was\nin draft format and did not represent official LLC policy, noting that the LLC\nhas no policy on land tax implementation because its members are unable to\nagree. The complainant also said that the article gave the misleading\nimpression that the Labour party and the LLC were affiliated, because it\nappeared to associate LLC research figures with Labour party policy.\n5. The newspaper\nsaid that the article made clear that it was reporting on a Conservative party\nanalysis of the proposals and not any official LLC policy. It said that whilst\na note on the LLC research paper indicated that it was a “draft”, the newspaper\nwas entitled to discuss the content of a published document that has been\nunamended and freely available on the group’s website since its publication.\nThe newspaper said that the article did not state or suggest that the LLC was\nformally affiliated to the Labour party, and said that the premise of the\narticle was made clear.\nRelevant Code provisions\n6.    Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated outcome\n7. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n8. Following IPSO’s\nintervention, the newspaper offered to publish the following clarification in\nits Corrections and Clarifications column on page 28 and as a footnote to the\nonline article:\n“In an article headlined “Tax on land 'would slash house\nprices’” (May 30),  we reported proposals\nfor a land value tax published by the Labour Land Campaign (LLC) and analysed\nby the  Conservative Party. The LLC has asked us to make clear that it is\nnot affiliated with the Labour Party; that the published paper was a draft; and\nthat it has no agreed policy on how to implement a land value tax because the\nnecessary information on land ownership in the United Kingdom is incomplete and\nmeaningful investigation of the secondary economic effects of such a change to\nthe basis of taxation is beyond the capabilities of any small, non-governmental\norganisation.”\n9. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to his satisfaction.\n10. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 17/7/2017Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 05/9/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
