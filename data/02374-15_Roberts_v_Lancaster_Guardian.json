John Roberts complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Lancaster Guardian had breached Clause 1\n(Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice by publishing a letter headlined\n“Pedestrians are getting a raw deal”, on 5 March 2015. \n2. The letter under complaint was about walking\nconditions for pedestrians, and encouraged people who were affected by poor\nconditions to campaign for safer streets. \n3. The complainant said that the letter had been\nattributed to him, signed with his name and partial address, but he had not\nsent the letter. \n4. The newspaper said that it had published the letter in\ngood faith. The email address from which it had been received was the same one\nwhich the complainant was using for his correspondence with IPSO. The newspaper\nprovided a copy of the email it had received. It said that it requires letter\nwriters to supply a full name and address, and that that condition had been met\non this occasion. It said that it had no reason to suspect that the letter was\nnot genuine. It was not considered controversial in any way, and was deemed\nsuitable for publication. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \nFindings of the Committee\n6. The newspaper had followed its standard procedures\nregarding the publication of readers’ letters. In attributing the letter to the\ncomplainant the newspaper had not failed to take care over the accuracy of the\nletter. The newspaper had also been able to show that the email had been\nreceived from an email address used by the complainant, in which the\ncomplainant’s name and address had been provided. There was no breach of Clause\n1 (i). The Committee noted that the content of the letter was innocuous and did\nnot reveal any private information about the complainant; the Committee did not\nidentify any significant inaccuracies which would require correction under the\nterms of Clause 1 (ii). \nConclusions\n7. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 30/03/2015\nDate decision issued: 22/05/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
