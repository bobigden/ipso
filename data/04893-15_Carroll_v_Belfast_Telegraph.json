Andrew Carroll complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Belfast Telegraph had breached Clause 1\n(Accuracy) and Clause 3 (Privacy) of the Editors' Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “’Sam's Yer Man’ director sells home as police probe\nsuspicions his firm was sunk by employee fraud”, published on 5 August 2015. \n2. The article reported that Sam Duff Jnr, a director of\nS&R Electrics Limited – a Belfast electronic goods retailer popularly known\nas ‘Sam's Yer Man’ – had put his house up for sale; the business had recently\nclosed down and been placed into administration. The article was accompanied by\na photograph of the house in question, as well as a description of the\nproperty, its location and the asking price. \n3. The complainant said the newspaper's report was\ninaccurate because he was, in fact, the owner of the property, and Sam Duff Jnr\nwas his tenant. He said that following publication of the article, he had taken\nthe property off the market on the advice of his estate agent. He had also\nhired security staff after the property had been visited by creditors of\nS&R Electrics. \n4. The complainant also said that the publication of a\nphotograph of his house alongside the original article, and the subsequent\npublication in a correction to the article of his name as the owner of the\nproperty, represented an intrusion into his privacy. \n5. The newspaper accepted that the complainant was in\nfact the owner of the property, and that the article had been inaccurate. It\nsaid that the journalist, in researching the story, had checked the filing\nhistory for S&R Electrics on the Companies House website and found the home\naddress of Sam Duff Jnr. The journalist then did a Google search of the address\nand discovered that the house was listed for sale. Details of the property from\nthe Google search, as well as the photographs, were then published in the\narticle. No other checks were made in relation to the property. \n6. Having been contacted by the complainant on the day\nthe article was published, the newspaper issued corrections, both in print and\nonline, on the following day. The online version of the article was also\namended to remove all mention of the property. The print correction appeared\nunder the heading \"Andy Carroll\" and said: \nAn article stated, incorrectly, that Sam Duff Jnr, a\ndirector of S&R Electrics, is selling his Holywood home with an asking\nprice of more than £1m (News, August 5). In fact, Mr Duff is renting the\nproperty, at Glen Road, and the house has been put up for sale by its owner,\nAndy Carroll. We apologise to Mr Carroll for the error, which has since been\ncorrected online. \nThe online correction appeared under the heading “Andy\nCarroll” and said: \nAn article stated, incorrectly, that Sam Duff Jnr, a\ndirector of S&R Electrics, is selling his Holywood home with an asking\nprice of more than £1m (News, August 5). \nIn the newspaper’s view, publication of the correction on\npage 12 in an edition containing 56 pages constituted due prominence in\naccordance with Clause 1(ii) of the Code.          \n7. The complainant was not satisfied with the correction.\nHe pointed out that the original article appeared as the main story on page 4,\nhaving being flagged on the newspaper's front page, while the correction was\nplaced in a 'side-bar' on page 12. In addition, the correction was published\nunder the heading \"Andy Carroll\", a heading that he said offered no\nsuggestion that a correction was being published underneath, or that the\ncorrection referred to the S&R Electrics article. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n8. Clause 1 Accuracy \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving the\nRegulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance. \nClause 3 Privacy \ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. \nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into\nany individual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information. \niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals in\nprivate places without their consent. Note - Private places are public or\nprivate property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. \nFindings of the Committee\n9. In the circumstance where the property’s sale featured\nin the headline, it was not sufficient for the publication to simply locate the\naddress of Sam Duff Jnr and proceed on the basis that he was the legal owner of\nthe property without any further checks to ensure that the assumption was correct.\nThe newspaper had failed to take care over the accuracy of the article, and the\nCommittee found that the established inaccuracy gave a significantly misleading\nimpression of both who was the owner of the property, and the reasons behind\nthe property's sale; the inaccuracy required correction under Clause 1 (ii) of\nthe Code. \n10. The Committee welcomed the newspaper’s prompt\nrecognition that the article had been inaccurate, and the steps it had taken to\npublish a correction and apology, and amend the online article. However, Clause\n1(ii) of the Code states that a significantly inaccuracy must be corrected with\n\"due prominence\"; generally this will mean the same page or further\nforward than the page where the article originally appeared. The article had been\npublished on page 4 of the newspaper, but the correction appeared eight pages\nfurther back on page 12. The prominence of the correction was not sufficient,\nand the requirements of 1(ii) had not been met. \n11. The photograph of the complainant’s house published\nalongside the original article, and the subsequent publication of his name as\nthe owner of the property in the corrections, did not disclose any private\ninformation about the complainant and did not raise a breach of Clause 3. \nConclusions\n12. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1 (Accuracy). \nRemedial Action Required\n13. The Committee accepted that the original correction\nwas published promptly and in good faith; the wording of the correction\nrecognised the inaccuracy, and it contained an apology in the print edition. As\nsuch, it was satisfied that re-publication of the correction in an appropriate\nlocation would represent a sufficient remedy.  \n14. The newspaper was required to re-publish its\ncorrection either on page 4, where the article was originally published, or\nfurther forward in the newspaper. The correction should additionally state that\nit had been re-published following a ruling by the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation, with the word “correction” appearing in the headline. The full\nwording must be agreed with IPSO in advance. The correction on the online\narticle should make clear that the article had been amended, and should be\npublished at the foot of the online article. \nDate complaint received: 05/08/2015\nDate decision issued: 30/09/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
