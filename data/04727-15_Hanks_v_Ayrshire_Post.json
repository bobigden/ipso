David Hanks complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Ayrshire Post breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and\nClause 2 (Opportunity to reply) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Tied up in a Thai racket”, published on 15 May 2015.\n2. The article reported that the complainant, along\nwith co-defendant Alexander Matusov, was due to stand trial in Thailand on\ncharges of racketeering. It stated that the complainant was currently in\ncustody. It also reported that two years ago, a court had heard that the\ncomplainant had been a “henchman” for Drew Noyes, who had been accused of\nrunning a “protection racket” and had subsequently been jailed, and was said to\nhave organised a meeting between “Noyes and a businessman he tried to\nblackmail”. The article noted that, in previous proceedings, victim Mark Goulet\ntold the court “he was left terrified after Hanks visited his health clinic”.\nThe article further noted that the complainant “was also named in another\nattempted fraud”; that he and an associate “are said to have targeted American\nbillionaire TV tycoon Bill Monson”, “allegedly” telling him that they could\nhelp him to access the frozen fortune of former Thai Prime Minister Thaksin\nShinawatra, and that the complainant’s associate “wanted a fee of £7 million”.\n3. The complainant said that the article included a\nnumber of inaccuracies. He said that he had never been held in custody. He also\nnoted that his co-defendant was Alexander Komandorskiy, rather than Alexander\nMatusov as reported, and said that this inaccuracy erroneously implied that he\nhad a connection to the mafia. He also said that there had been no reference in\nthe Noyes case to any mafia. Furthermore, the complainant denied that he had\nbeen involved in an attempt to defraud Bill Monson; he said that no request for\n£7 million had been made by his associate.\n4. The complainant said that he had not been\ncontacted for comment prior to publication; he considered this to be a breach\nof Clause 2.\n5. While the complaint was on-going, the complainant\nwas cleared of all charges.\n6. The newspaper said that, at the time of\npublication, it believed the article to be accurate. It did not consider that\nthe erroneous reference to the complainant’s being held in custody and the\ninaccuracy regarding the name of his co-defendant represented significant\ninaccuracies in circumstances where the complainant had been charged with a\nserious crime. Nonetheless, it offered to publish a follow up story, on page 2\nof a future edition, noting that the complainant had not been remanded in\ncustody, and that all charges against him had subsequently been dismissed. This\nwould also correct the name of his co-defendant. A reference to the article\nwould be published on the front page of the relevant edition, directing readers\nto the page of the article. The newspaper provided the complainant and the\nCommittee with a draft wording for this article.\n7. The newspaper provided copies of emails sent to a\nrepresentative of Mr Monson, copied to the complainant, offering advice on how\nto claim assets from a company formerly owned by Dr Thaksin. It said that this\nrepresentative had told the newspaper’s reporter that the request for a fee of\n£7 million had been set out in a meeting between him, the complainant, and the\ncomplainant’s associate.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish\ninaccurate, misleading or distorted information, including pictures.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement\nor distortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due\nprominence, and – where appropriate – an apology published. In cases involving\nthe regulator, prominence should be agreed with the regulator in advance.\nClause 2 (Opportunity to reply)\nA fair opportunity for reply to inaccuracies must be\ngiven when reasonably called for.\nFindings of the Committee\n9. The newspaper had not been able to demonstrate\nthat it had taken care over the accuracy of its report with regard to the\nreference to his being in custody and name of the complainant’s co-defendant.\nThese elements were central claims about the nature and status of the\nproceedings, and the newspaper could have verified these details. In the\nabsence of any explanation for the publication of the inaccurate information,\nthe Committee established a breach of 1(i). The inaccuracies were significant\nones, which should be corrected to avoid a breach of 1(ii).\n10. The article had not made any further alleged\nlink between the complainant and the mafia; there was therefore nothing for the\nCommittee to consider on this point.\n11. The Committee noted the complainant’s denial\nthat he had been involved in an attempt to defraud Bill Monson. The article had\nclearly presented this as an allegation, and had made clear that no finding of\nfact, or legal ruling, had been made on the matter. The complainant was not in\na position to deny that a representative of Mr Monson had claimed that he had\nbeen involved in a fraud attempt, and that his associate had requested a fee of\n£7 million. Given the way in which the material had been presented, there was\nno breach of Clause 1.\n12. Clause 2 does not include a requirement to seek\ncomment prior to publication; rather, it provides an opportunity to respond to\npublished inaccuracies. The complainant had not requested an opportunity to\nrespond, but had requested that inaccuracies in the article be corrected. There\nwas no breach of Clause 2.\n13. Given that the complainant had later been\ncleared of all charges, it was appropriate for the newspaper to publish an\nupdate on his case. The Committee welcomed the newspaper’s offer to do so, to\ncomply with its obligations to accurately report on such matters.\nConclusions\n14. The complaint was upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n15. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1 (i), the\nCommittee considered what remedial action should be required. The Committee had\nreviewed the newspaper’s draft wording for a follow-up article, which\nidentified the inaccuracies which the Committee had identified in the article,\nand reported the correct position. This follow-up story, which was due to\nappear on page 2, with a reference on page 1, where the original article had\nappeared, was an appropriate remedy to the breach of Clause 1. This should now\nbe published.\nDate complaint received: 24/07/2015Date decision issued: 09/12/2015\n \n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
