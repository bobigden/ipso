In circumstances where the Committee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the publication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of which is determined by IPSO.21. The article headline reported that the complainant was “unable to read or write” and the sub-headline and text of the article reported that the complainant had \"issues understanding written tests” The action proposed by the publication was not sufficient to correct these significant inaccuracies as it did not address that the headline had the potential to mislead readers into believing that the complainant was illiterate, which was not supported by either the article or the tribunal judgment. In addition, the proposed correction did not address the misleading report that the complainant had issues understanding written tests. Therefore, the Committee required that the wording of the proposed correction should be amended to make clear that the complainant can read and write and that he experiences difficulty with comprehension speed and not understanding written tests. The Committee considered a correction to be the appropriate remedy to the breaches of Clause 1(i), where the crux of the article – the outcome of the tribunal and appeal – was not inaccurate, misleading, or distorted.22. The Committee then considered the placement of the correction. It should appear as a footnote to the original online article, and should make clear that the complainant’s difficulties were linked to his dyspraxia. It should state that it has been published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation. The full wording and position should be agreed with IPSO in advance.  Date complaint received: 07/04/2020",
    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision\nof the Complaints Committee – 02471-20 Ahmed v thesun.co.ukSummary\nof Complaint1. Faisal\nAhmed complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nthesun.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 12 (Discrimination) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “WRITING’S ON THE WALL\nTeacher sent to work at top secondary school despite being unable to READ and\nwrite” published on 7 April 2019.2. The\narticle reported that a teacher had been passed fit to teach by a teacher\ntraining scheme even though he had “extreme difficulty with handwriting”,\nreading problems, and “issues understanding written tests”. It reported that he\nhad been sent to the school despite struggling to read and write, that “the alarm\nwas raised days into his new job” and that the headmaster summoned him to a\nmeeting and suspended him. It reported that the man had dyspraxia and that he\ntold the headmaster that he could “hardly write” for “more than a couple of\nminutes” as it was too painful. It reported that details of this “2016 scandal”\nemerged after the man sued the school for constructive dismissal and disability\ndiscrimination after “quitting in fury”. The article reported that an\nemployment tribunal “threw out” his claims, and that he lost an appeal. 3. The\ncomplainant was the teacher referred to in the article. He said that the\narticle was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) because it was not the\ncase that he was unable to read or write as reported in the headline, which\ngave the impression that he was illiterate. He said that he could read and\nwrite and that there were multiple passages in the tribunal judgments which\nmade this clear he also noted that he had two degrees, which he would not have\nbeen able to obtain had he been “unable to read and write”.  .  The\ncomplainant explained that he had difficulties with handwriting – due to hand\npain caused by dyspraxia – and reading comprehension speed and that he could\nwrite using a keyboard and by the use of other technology; these difficulties\ndid not mean that he could not read or write. He said that the comments left\nunderneath the article – as well as being offensive – demonstrated that readers\nhad understood the article to be reporting that he was unable to read or write.\nThe complainant also said that it was misleading to report in the sub headline\nto the article that he had “extreme difficulty with handwriting”, reading\nproblems and “issues understanding written tests”. He complained that the first\ntwo claims, which were taken from the tribunal judgments, were misleading\nbecause, in isolation, they added to the impression that he was illiterate,\nrather than having specific difficulties arising from his dyspraxia.  He said that the third of these claims was\ninaccurate because it suggested that he had difficulties understanding words,\nrather than difficulties with reading comprehension speed.  He said that the article should have made\nexplicit that these difficulties were symptoms of his dyspraxia, and he was\nconcerned that readers may not link the article’s reference to his dyspraxia\nwith his comprehension and handwriting difficulties.  4. The\ncomplainant raised further points under Clause 1. He disputed that he had been\nemployed at a “top school” – he said that it did not top any national league\ntable and that the school was not even the top school in the local area,\nregardless of the fact that it had an ‘Outstanding’ Ofsted rating.. He said\nthat he did not sue the school – rather he filed a claim against the Academy Trust\nthat it fell under. He said that it was misleading to say that he quit “in\nfury” as this gave the impression that his decision was rash and he took legal\naction without consideration. Furthermore, the complainant said that it was\nmisleading to say that the tribunal “threw out” his claims as he considered\nthat this implied his case was struck out or dismissed without a full hearing,\nwhen in fact his claim had been decided on its merits following a five-day\nhearing. He said that by reporting in the same sentence that he then lost his\nappeal gave the impression that his appeal was rejected by the same tribunal,\nrather than it being considered by the separate appeal tribunal. 5. In\naddition, the complainant said the headline was misleading to say that he had\nbeen “sent to work” at the school as it gave the impression this was a\nunilateral decision by the teacher training scheme. Rather, the school\napproached the scheme; he had, as confirmed in the tribunal judgment, been\n“offer[ed] a Teach First contract” at the school. He also said it was\nmisleading to report that the teacher training scheme passed him as being fit\nto teach – in fact, he had also been deemed medically fit to teach by several\noccupational doctors including by one commissioned by the school. He said that\nthe article was inaccurate to describe dyspraxia as simply a “co-ordination\ncondition” when it was a nuanced, diverse, and severe condition, particularly\nas the article did not expressly state that his difficulties with comprehension\nspeed and with handwriting were symptoms of his dyspraxia. The complainant also\nsaid that it was inaccurate to describe his original departure from the school\nin 2016 as a “scandal” – he said that there was no reporting by the media at\nthe time. He also said that it was misleading to say that “the alarm was\nraised” days after he began teaching at the school because this implied that he\nhad concealed his learning disability from the school which was not the case.\nFinally, the complainant said that reporting that he had failed in his tribunal\nand appeal without including criticism of the headteacher added to the\nmisleading impression that his case was foolish and baseless.6. The\ncomplainant also said that the article breached Clause 12. He said that by\ninaccurately reporting that he was unable to read or write, this constituted a\npejorative and prejudicial reference to his dyspraxia, and may have a negative\neffect on his future employment prospects. He also said that this was\nexacerbated by the article’s overall tone that his disability claim was foolish\nand without merit. He said that the article should have included a comment from\nsomeone in the field of dyspraxia, and the condition should have been better\nexplained beyond describing it as a “co-ordination condition”. He noted again\nthat the comments left below the article were insulting, and he was concerned\nabout the effect the article would have on the wider dyspraxia community. The\ncomplainant also said that the article breached Clause 12 by giving publicity\nto his tribunal and appeal, and thus making his disability more widely\nknown.  7. The\npublication did not accept that the article breached the Code. It said that the\ncomplainant acknowledged that he had difficulties reading and writing, and the\nEmployment Appeal Tribunal (EAT) had accepted that the complainant has\ndyspraxia which causes him to have “difficulties with reading, comprehension\nspeed and handwriting”. It also said that the EAT ruling described him as being\nunable to write for more than a minute or two. It noted that the prominent\nsub-headline of the article said that the complainant “had ‘extreme difficulty\nwith handwriting’, reading problems and ‘issues understanding written tests’”\nand the first sentence of the article said that he was placed at the school\ndespite “struggling” with reading and writing. It said that these were accurate\nsummaries of the difficulties experienced by the complainant. It then said that\nas such, the headline should be read in the context of the article as a whole,\nand those who read both the headline and sub-headline together would not be\nmisled as to the level of the complainant’s difficulties. The publication also\nsaid that the speed with which a reader ingests and assimilates the written\nword is as much a part of his or her functional literacy as the ability to\nunderstand the words; it therefore maintained that the complainant's difficulty\nwith comprehension speed could accurately be described as an “issue\nunderstanding written tests\". Nevertheless, in the publication’s first\nresponse to the complaint, it offered to amend the headline to read: “WRITING’S\nON THE WALL Teacher sent to work at top secondary school despite struggling\nwith READING and writing” and to add the following footnote to the article:“A\nprevious headline on this article described Faisal Ahmed as being ‘unable’ to\nread or write. In fact, as the article made clear, he struggled with reading\nand writing. We are happy to clarify.”It also\noffered to remove the online article from the publication’s website if this\nwould resolve the complaint. This was declined by the complainant.8. The\npublication said that it was not misleading to say that the complainant’s\nclaims had been thrown out – it said that it did not necessarily mean that the\nclaim had been struck out, but that the judgment had gone against him which was\naccurate in this case. It said that it was not inaccurate or misleading to omit\nthe name of the legal entity against which the claim had been brought – in this\ncase the Academy Trust. It said that it was also not inaccurate to say that the\ncomplainant quit “in fury” – it said that he was clearly angry at the school’s\ntreatment of him as he subsequently spent two and half years pursuing legal\naction against the school. It said that it was not misleading to describe the\nschool as a “top school”; it was rated as “Outstanding” by Ofsted at the time\nof publication. The newspaper did not accept that the rest of the points raised\nby the complainant represented breaches of the Code.9. The\npublication said the article did not breach Clause 12 – the complainant’s\ndisability was central to the two judgments and so it was clearly relevant to\ninclude details about his disability in order to report on the tribunal\nproceedings. Furthermore, it said that the article’s descriptions of the\neffects of the complainant’s disability were also central to the report. It\nsaid that the article did not contain any prejudicial or pejorative references\nto the complainant’s disability; it was a straightforward description of what\nwas set out in the tribunal. It noted that the complainant had simultaneously\ntried to argue in his complaint that mentioning his disability was unnecessary,\nbut that the article should also have included more details about his\ndisability. When it was brought to its attention that the complainant\nconsidered the readers’ comments to be racist and Islamophobic, it removed\nthese from the website.Relevant\nCode ProvisionsClause 1\n(Accuracy)i) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.ii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and – where appropriate – an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator.iii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.iv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.Clause\n12 (Discrimination)i) The\npress must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual's, race,\ncolour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or to any physical\nor mental illness or disability.ii)\nDetails of an individual's race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual\norientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided unless\ngenuinely relevant to the story.Findings\nof the Committee10. The\narticle was based on the judgments of the tribunals which the Committee\nconsidered in order to assess whether the reported claims about the complainant\nwere inaccurate or misleading.  The\nheadline of the article reported that the complainant was “unable” to read or\nwrite. However, this claim was not supported by the tribunal judgments. It was\nclear from the tribunal judgments that the complainant had been diagnosed with\ndyspraxia and that it had heard that, as a result, he experienced difficulties\nwith his handwriting and with reading comprehension speed. The tribunals had\nalso heard that the complainant sought to overcome these difficulties by using\nIT.  In its finding, the Employment\nTribunal expressly noted that it was not in dispute between the parties that\nthe complainant had been suspended from the school because he was unable to\nwrite for more than a minute or two due to hand pain, and that this difficulty\narose from his disability. Given that the nature of the complainant’s\ndifficulties were clear from the tribunal judgments, there was a failure to\ntake care over the accuracy of the headline in breach of Clause 1(i), with the\nCommittee noting that an accurate article cannot act as a correction for an inaccurate\nor misleading headline. Reporting that the complainant was unable to read or\nwrite, when this was not the position, represented a significant inaccuracy\nwhich required correction under the terms of Clause 1(ii).11. In\nthe publication’s first response to the complaint it offered to amend the\nheadline to delete the reference to the complainant being unable to read or\nwrite and to report instead that he had become a teacher at the school despite\n“struggling with reading and writing”, and to add a footnote to record this\nchange. While the Committee recognised that the publication had taken prompt\nsteps to attempt to address the complainant’s concerns, it found that the\naction proposed was not sufficient. The proposed correction did not acknowledge\nthat the complainant is able to read and write and the footnote also omitted to\nexplain that the headline was being corrected for that reason.  Therefore, the action offered by the\npublication was not sufficient to put the correct position on record, and there\nwas a further breach of Clause 1 (ii).12. The\nsub headline and text of the article reported that the complainant had\n\"issues understanding written tests”. \nIt appeared that the publication had relied on a passage of the\nEmployment Tribunal judgment which had quoted a letter from an occupational\nhealth doctor in which he noted that the complainant had an issue with\n\"comprehension of written tests”. \nThe Committee noted that this passage was open to interpretation, but in\nthe same paragraph of the judgment it was recorded that the complainant had\nbeen certified fit to teach by the doctor. \nFurther, earlier in the judgment, the tribunal had made clear that\ndyspraxia manifests itself, amongst other things, in difficulties with\ncomprehension speed.  The report that the\ncomplainant had issues \"understanding” written tests did not reflect what\nhad been heard at the tribunal and the findings which had been made by the\ntribunal as to the nature of the difficulties which are caused by dyspraxia and\nfrom which the complainant suffers. There was, therefore, a failure to take\ncare under Clause 1(i) not to report misleading information. The distinction\nbetween ‘difficulties with comprehension speed’ and ‘issues understanding\nwritten tests’ was significant and a correction was required.  The publication had not offered a correction\non this point and there was a further breach of clause 1(ii).13. Turning\nto the other alleged breaches arising from the sub-headline of the article, the\nCommittee noted that the report that the complainant had “extreme difficulty\nwith handwriting” had been taken from the judgment of the Employment Tribunal\nand had been said by the complainant himself. \nThe tribunal judgments also acknowledged that the complainant had\nproblems with reading.  These claims were\nrepeated in the text of the article which also reported that the complainant\nsuffers from dyspraxia and the Committee considered it was made sufficiently\nclear within the body of the article that these difficulties were linked to the\ncomplainant’s dyspraxia.     The\nCommittee found that it was not misleading to describe the school as a “top\nschool” when it had been rated “outstanding” by Ofsted and it was not\nsignificant in the context of the overall article whether the complainant\nbrought legal action against the school or the Academy Trust.  There wasno \nbreach of Clause 1 on these points.14. It\nwas the newspaper’s own characterisation of the complainant’s actions to\ndescribe him as having quit “in fury” and this was not significantly misleading\nwhere it was clear that the complainant felt strongly that his former employer\nhad acted unlawfully in its treatment of him and this led to him pursuing\nclaims in the Employment Tribunal. Where the complainant's claims had been\nunsuccessful, it was not misleading to describe them as having been “thrown\nout” and where it was made clear that the complainant had then appealed this\ndecision, the article was not misleading by having omitted that the appeal had\nbeen heard by an appeal tribunal. There was no breach of Clause 1 on these\npoints.15. It\nwas not inaccurate to report that the complainant had been “sent to work” at\nthe school – the placement had been organised by the teacher training scheme,\nand the article did not claim that it was organised without the involvement of\nthe school. It was not misleading for the article to omit the fact that the\ncomplainant had been certified as fit to teach by multiple occupational health\ndoctors when it was not in dispute that he had been so certified by the teaching\ntraining scheme, as reported. It did not appear to be in dispute that dyspraxia\nis a condition which affects co-ordination, and where the article was a report\nof the legal action brought by the complainant and not a detailed examination\nof dyspraxia, it was not inaccurate in the context of the overall article to\nsummarise dyspraxia as a “co-ordination condition”. That the complainant’s\nappointment at the school was a “scandal” in the circumstances was reported as\nthe view of the publication.  Whilst the complainant\ndisagreed with this description, it was a matter of opinion which the\npublication was entitled to express. Reporting that “the alarm was raised” was\nnot inaccurate in circumstances where the tribunal heard that the headmaster\nhad not previously been aware of the complainant's difficulties, despite the\ndisclosures which he had made. Finally, the Editors’ Code does not include a\nrequirement for balance, as long as the Code is not otherwise breached. In this\ncase, omitting criticism of the headteacher, or implying that the complainant\nhad acted unwisely, did not raise a breach of the Code. For all of these\nreasons, there was no breach of Clause 1 on these points.16. Although\nit was inaccurate for the headline to say that the complainant could not read,\nthis was distinct from the issues raised under Clause 12. The question for the\nCommittee was whether this reference, and the other issues raised by the\ncomplainant, constituted a pejorative reference to his disability – dyspraxia.\nThe Committee considered that claiming that the complainant could not read was\nnot a pejorative reference to his dyspraxia and the article did not seek to\nmock or ridicule his disability. With regards to the rest of the article, the\ncomplainant’s disability was at the heart of the claims which he pursued before\nthe tribunals and on which the articles were reporting. The publication was\nentitled to comment on the merits of the complainant’s legal action – the fact\nthat the complainant’s disability was a key element of this legal action did\nnot mean that any criticism constituted a pejorative or prejudicial reference\nto his disability. Furthermore, newspapers are free to select which information\nto include in articles; the absence of a more detailed explanation of dyspraxia\nor a comment from an expert in the field did not constitute a pejorative or\nprejudicial reference to the complainant’s disability. There was no breach of\nClause 12. 17. The\ncomplainant was concerned about the negative reaction to the article from\nreaders, and the effect that the article would have on the wider dyspraxia\ncommunity. However, Clause 12 seeks to protect individuals from discrimination\nrather than groups – as such, the complainant’s concern that the article may be\ndiscriminatory towards people with dyspraxia as a whole did not engage the\nterms of Clause 12. Finally, the complainant raised concerns over the article’s\ninclusion of details of his disability at all. However, the complainant’s\ndisability and the associated difficulties he had faced were genuinely relevant\nto the story, where the article was reporting on his legal claims that his\nformer employer had harassed and discriminated against his as a result of his\ndisability. There was no breach of Clause 12(ii). 18. IPSO’s\nregulations state that specific readers’ comments can fall within IPSO’s remit\nas editorial content if they remain online after being reported to the\nnewspaper. In this case, although the complainant raised concerns about the\ncomments, he did not take steps to report them to the newspaper and did not ask\nthe Committee to consider whether the publication of any specific comments\nraised a breach of the Editors’ Code. As such, the Committee did not make any\nfinding on whether the publication of these comments breached the Editors’\nCode, whilst noting that the newspaper had removed them once the complainant’s\nconcerns had been brought to its attention.Conclusions19. The\ncomplaint was upheld under Clause 1.Remedial\nAction Required20.\nHaving upheld a breach of Clause 1(i) and Clause 1(ii), the Committee\nconsidered what remedial action should be required. In circumstances where the\nCommittee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the\npublication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of\nwhich is determined by IPSO.21. The\narticle headline reported that the complainant was “unable to read or write”\nand the sub-headline and text of the article reported that the complainant had\n\"issues understanding written tests” The action proposed by the\npublication was not sufficient to correct these significant inaccuracies as it\ndid not address that the headline had the potential to mislead readers into\nbelieving that the complainant was illiterate, which was not supported by either\nthe article or the tribunal judgment. In addition, the proposed correction did\nnot address the misleading report that the complainant had issues understanding\nwritten tests. Therefore, the Committee required that the wording of the\nproposed correction should be amended to make clear that the complainant can\nread and write and that he experiences difficulty with comprehension speed and\nnot understanding written tests. The Committee considered a correction to be\nthe appropriate remedy to the breaches of Clause 1(i), where the crux of the\narticle – the outcome of the tribunal and appeal – was not inaccurate,\nmisleading, or distorted.22. The\nCommittee then considered the placement of the correction. It should appear as\na footnote to the original online article, and should make clear that the\ncomplainant’s difficulties were linked to his dyspraxia. It should state that\nit has been published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation. The full wording and position should be agreed with\nIPSO in advance.  Date\ncomplaint received: 07/04/2020Date\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 26/08/2021  Independent\nComplaints Reviewer\nThe\ncomplainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process\nfollowed by IPSO in handling this complaint.
