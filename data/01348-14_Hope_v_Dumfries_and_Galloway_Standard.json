Jonathan Hope complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Dumfries and Galloway Standard had breached\nClause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined\n“Kids porn shame of Queens bidder”, published on 10 August 2014. \n2. The article said that the complainant had a criminal\nconviction for downloading child pornography, and that the parents of children\ninvolved with a youth football team sponsored by the complainant had been\n“angry” when this had been discovered. It said that he had been convicted in\n2003 under the name “Steven Hope”. The article also reported that the\ncomplainant claimed to have been involved in the transfer of the footballer\nDanny Welbeck, but that this had been denied by the clubs and representatives\nof the player. \n3. The complainant said that the coverage had\nmisrepresented his role with the youth football club; he was not actively\ninvolved with the club and did not sponsor the team, although his name had been\nput on the back of the shirts as a gesture for his having found the team a\nsponsor. He also said that contrary to the claims in the article he had been\ntrying to broker a deal between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur,\nalthough he had not spoken to Mr Welbeck or his representative directly. \n4. The complainant expressed concern that the journalist\nhad used his involvement in football as a means to disclose the fact that he\nhad a spent criminal conviction. \n5. The newspaper said that as the complainant’s name had\nappeared on the back of the youth football club’s shirts, it had not been\nsignificantly misleading to report that he sponsored the club. \n6. After the complainant had been interviewed on the\nradio, Danny Welbeck’s representatives had contacted Radio 5 Live to say that\nthe complainant had not been involved in the deal, even as a middleman. A\nrepresentative of the Welbeck brothers told the newspaper “I will spell out the\nposition of the Welbecks so there is absolutely no room for doubt. Jonathan Hope\nis a person we have never heard of, until he went on national radio”. The\nnewspaper had contacted the player’s representatives and the clubs concerned\nwho had confirmed that the complainant had no involvement with the transfer. \n7. The newspaper said that it was entitled to publish\ndetails of the complainant’s conviction, particularly as it was a matter of\npublic concern given his involvement with the children’s football club. \n8. The newspaper raised serious concerns about the\nconduct of the complainant during the course of Ipso’s investigation. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n9. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni)The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \nFindings of the Committee\n10. The complainant had appeared on the radio, and was\ninterviewed on the premise that he was “the man brokering a deal” for Danny\nWelbeck, and he had not corrected that description of him. During the course of\nthe interview he had suggested that he was actively engaged in the deal, and\nwas in direct discussion with the parties. The reporter subsequently contacted\nthe complainant and the football clubs concerned. As such, the Committee was\nsatisfied that there had not been a failure to take care over the accuracy of\nthe article; there was no breach of Clause 1 (i). The newspaper had been\nentitled to report that the clubs denied having any involvement with the\ncomplainant. There was no breach of the Code on this point. \n11. The complainant accepted that his name had featured\non the football kit of the youth team in response to his playing a direct role\nin arranging the team’s sponsorship. The article reported concerns raised in\nrelation to his association with children in light of his conviction. In this\ncontext, it had not been significantly misleading to state that he had\nsponsored the club. There was no breach of the Code on this point. \n12. The selection of material for publication is a matter\nfor the discretion of individual editors, provided that such editorial\ndecisions do not engage the terms of the Editors’ Code. It had not been\ninaccurate to report that the complainant had a previous criminal conviction.\nThere was no breach of the Code. \nConclusions\n13. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 27/03/2015\nDate decision issued: 15/05/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
