A woman complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that the Evening Chronicle had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in a series of articles. \n2. The newspaper had published a number of reports about\na trial in which the complainant’s son was accused, and subsequently convicted,\nof manslaughter. \n3. The complainant was concerned that the coverage was\ninaccurate and significantly misleading. She said that the coverage had given\ngreater weight to the evidence presented by the prosecution than the defence.\nShe was also concerned that the coverage said that the victim had been killed\n“for a laugh”, and that it had quoted a comment by the mother of the victim\nstating that the defendant had shown “no remorse”. She said that these were\nallegations which had not been proven in court. \n4. The complainant said that the Judge had criticised the\nreporting of the trial. The complainant did not, however, provide specific\ninformation regarding the nature of the Judge’s concern. \n5. The newspaper did not accept that the coverage had\nbeen inaccurate or significantly misleading. It said that it had been entitled\nto report on public court proceedings as these were matters of public interest,\nparticularly as the defendant had been convicted and given a custodial\nsentence. The reporter had attended the prosecution opening, the hearing of the\ndefendant’s evidence, the verdict and the sentence. The newspaper said that\nthere is no requirement under the Code to publish a balanced report of events.\nIt had, however, published reports covering both the prosecution and defence\ncases. \n6. It said that the Judge’s remarks had not been directed\nsolely toward the Evening Chronicle. Its reporter had approached the Judge and\nasked him to clarify his comments, so he could ensure the accuracy of the\narticles. The Judge had responded that he could not remember exactly what the\nissue was or whether it had been in the reporter’s articles. \n7. The prosecution had alleged that the victim had been\n“killed for a laugh”. It provided the reporter’s notes and documents from the\ncourt which showed that this had been alleged by the prosecution. The claim\nthat the defendant had shown no remorse had clearly been distinguished as a\ncomment made by the mother. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n8. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \niii) The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nFindings of the Committee\n9. The newspaper had been entitled to report information\nwhich had been disclosed as part of the court proceedings. Under the terms of\nthe Code, there is no obligation for newspapers to give equal coverage to\narguments made by both the prosecution and defence, provided that the coverage\ndoes not represent a misleading or distorted account of the proceedings. The\nnewspaper’s coverage had reported the arguments presented by the prosecution\nand the defence, and it was not in dispute that the newspaper had accurately\nreported the outcome of the trial. \n10. The newspaper’s reporting of the proceedings during\nthe proceedings had made clear that the reference to the defendant as having\nkilled the victim “for a laugh” was an allegation made by the prosecution, rather\nthan a fact established by the court. Following the jury’s verdict, two reports\nhad used this phrase in connection with the conviction. While the Committee\nnoted that these two reports had not identified the phrase as having been used\nby the prosecution, this was not significantly misleading in the context of his\nconviction, which signified the jury’s acceptance of the prosecution case and\nits rejection of the defendant’s claim that he had acted in self-defence. There\nwas no breach of the Code on this point. \n11. The claim that the defendant had shown no remorse had\nbeen correctly attributed to the family member, and clearly represented her\npersonal view; the article did not suggest that was a position which had been\nshared by the court. The newspaper had not failed to distinguish comment from\nfact. There was no breach of the Code on this. \n12. While the Committee noted the complainant’s concern\nabout the views apparently expressed by the Judge, in the absence of\ninformation regarding the Judge’s specific concerns about the coverage, the\nCommittee did not consider this point further.\nConclusions\n13. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 08/04/2015\nDate decision issued: 30/06/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
