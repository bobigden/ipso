We are on just a small private lane but it was an emergency situation\nin which unfortunately a male resident died”. The article reported a statement\nfrom the police: “We are aware that ambulances were blocked in at the scene but\nthere were no arrests”. 4.  The complainant was one of two individuals who were alleged to have\nblocked the ambulances in with their cars. He denied that ambulances had been\nblocked in at the scene, and said that this was a false claim which had\noriginated from a member of staff at the care home. The complainant said that although\nhe had not been named, sufficient information was published to allow him to be\nidentified, which was intrusive given the inaccurate claims being reported. 5.  The complainant provided a letter from the ambulance service, in which\nit said that it was unable to confirm whether or not its vehicles were\nprevented from leaving the scene. The complainant also provided correspondence\nwhich he had received from the police. The police said that when they had been\napproached by the media, they did not give\nany indication that the blocking was done by a vehicle or was deliberate; the\npolice said that they had simply confirmed that it had received a report of\nthat nature. 6.  The publication said that the reporter gathered information and\nstatements from several sources, witnesses at the scene, the care home manager,\nthe police and the ambulance services; all of these accounts accurately\nreflected each other's description of what happened and confirmed that the\nambulances were blocked in. The publication did not accept that the information\ncontained in the article would have led readers to identify the complainant.\nRelevant Code Provisions 7. Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The Press must take care not to publish\ninaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines\nnot supported by the text. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement\nor distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant\ninaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for. iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and\ncampaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. Clause 2 (Privacy)i) Everyone is\nentitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and\ncorrespondence, including digital communications.ii) Editors will be\nexpected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without\nconsent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy,\naccount will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of\ninformation and the extent to which the material complained about is already in\nthe public domain or will become so.\niii) It is\nunacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or\nprivate places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nMediated outcome 8. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter. 9. During IPSO’s investigation, the publication\noffered to remove the article from its website, as a gesture of goodwill, which\nthe complainant confirmed resolved the complaint to his satisfaction. 10. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 18/02/2019Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 17/04/2019\n \n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
