Patrick\nReynolds complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the\nDaily Mail breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) in two articles headlined “CORBYN THE\nBOMB MAKER'S HELPER”, published on the 4 December 2019 and “Why DID Jeremy\nCorbyn share offices with a convicted IRA bomb maker... who was embroiled in a\n£550k scandal?”, published on 5 December 2019.\n2. The\nfirst article set out associations in the 1980s between Jeremy Corbyn MP and a\nman who had been convicted of conspiring to cause explosions. The article began\nby introducing the man and examining how he came to live in Islington. The\nsub-headline said that “admirer Jeremy Corbyn helped create a council job for\n[the man]”. The article went on to focus on this job which was at an organisation\ncalled the Irish in Islington Project. The article reported that the Irish in\nIslington Project was founded in 1983 and described it as one of a number of\npressure groups “under the umbrella of Corbyn’s IBRG [Irish in Britain\nRepresentation Group]”. It reported that the IBRG was a pro-republican group\nwhich supported Mr Corbyn in his campaign to become the MP for Islington North.\n3. The\narticle reported that “inevitably” the Irish in Islington Project applied to\nIslington Council for funding to pay for full time staff and headquarters. It\nreported that Mr Corbyn sought “successfully” to find funding for the project\nelsewhere, and referred to a letter sent to Ethnic Minorities Unit at the\nGreater London Council (GLC) in which Mr Corbyn said: “The work of the Irish in\nIslington Project is both necessary and desirable, and I urge that their\napplication for two project workers be met”. \nIt also reported that John McDonnell MP wrote to the GLC in 1984 to say\n“I understand that the Irish in Islington Project will shortly be submitting an\napplication for capital funds to establish an Irish Centre. I would like to\nlend my support to the Project and could you keep me informed of its progress”.\nThe article then said “You might be already to be able to guess who was to be\ngiven one of these posts”, as approximately two weeks after the man was\nreleased from prison, he took up the position of “community outreach worker” at\nthe Project. It said that “thanks to Corbyn and friends, [named man’s] future\nwas secure”. The article reported that Mr Corbyn had not responded to a request\nfor comment on the claims, however it reported that the man had said “I knew\nJeremy back in the Eighties and Nineties. He was my MP when I was living in\nEngland”.\n4. The\nsecond article expanded upon the man’s job at the Irish in Islington Project\nwhilst repeating several points which had been made in the first article. It\nsaid that: “Within days of release, terrorist [name] landed a plum council job\nthanks to Labour’s leader” and that he received “assistance” from “Labour’s\ncurrent leadership”. It also said that the man enjoyed “what could be described\nas a charmed life – thanks in part at least to his friends John McDonnell and\nJeremy Corbyn”, that the two positions at the Irish in Islington Project were\n“promoted” by Mr Corbyn and Mr McDonnell, and that the man was “handed not one\nbut two taxpayer-funded jobs close to his tax-payer funded home in London”. It\ndescribed the Irish in Islington Project as a “subsidiary” of the IBRG.\n5. The\narticle also said that “Archive records examined by the Mail show [man] and\n[other man] set up an office in a community centre in the heart of Corbyn’s\nconstituency in Archway, North London. Corbyn himself used the same address for\nhis monthly constituency surgeries”. The article repeated a point made in the\nfirst article that 13 days after the Brighton bombings in 1984, Mr Corbyn\nhosted the man and others at the House of Commons. It went on to report that\nthe following day, the GLC approved a grant to the Irish in Islington’s “sister\nproject” – the Irish in Greenwich Project. It reported that the man returned to\nthe House of Commons for a press conference organised by the IBRG. Finally, the\narticle reported that the man had since left London and moved back to Northern\nIreland, where he became a Sinn Fein councillor.\n6. The\ncomplainant worked at the Irish in Islington Project at the time the man was\nemployed in the 1980s. He said that the two articles contained a number of\ninaccuracies, and that a representative from the Irish in Islington Project\nshould have been contacted prior to publication.\n7. The\ncomplainant said that both articles were misleading, as they gave the\nimpression that the man had obtained his job at the Irish in Islington Project\nin a corrupt way. The complainant said that he was on the panel which appointed\nthe man, and Mr Corbyn had nothing to do with his shortlisting or appointment.\nHe said that the man met the criteria for the job – which he said was not a council\njob – and there was a proper process for the appointment. He said that it was\nhis view that Mr Corbyn would not have known the man or about his appointment\nin 1983 – the steps Mr Corbyn took to support the Project were standard for any\nlocal MP. As such, any reference in either of the articles to Mr Corbyn or Mr\nMcDonnell helping create the man’s job, promote the two positions, or give the\nman any “assistance” was misleading. He said that neither Mr Corbyn nor Mr\nMcDonnell promoted either of the two men who filled the roles at the Project.\nSimilarly, the first article was misleading to say that “you might be able to\nguess who was given one of these posts” and that it was not the case that the\nman’s future was secure thanks to Mr Corbyn or that the man was “handed” the\njob. In regards to the second article, the complainant said that its references\nto the man having enjoyed a “charmed life, thanks in part to his friends John\nMcDonnell and Jeremy Corbyn” was also misleading for the same reasons. The\ncomplainant also said that it was not the case that the Irish in Islington\nProject sought funding from Islington Council, or that Mr Corbyn sought funding\nfrom elsewhere. He later went on to clarify that the Project did not seek\nfunding from Islington Council when it was first established; the funding it\nwent on to receive from Islington Council was allocated automatically following\nthe abolition of the GLC.\n8. With\nregards to the first article specifically, the complainant said that it was\ninaccurate to describe the IBRG as “Corbyn’s” IBRG as it had other members who\nwere politicians, from a range of parties. He said that Mr Corbyn had no input\ninto the IBRG apart from speaking at public meetings, raising issues in the\nHouse of Commons, and hosting a meeting in December 1983 with the IBRG where he\nlooked at ways to support the Irish community. The complainant said that the\narticle should not have labelled the IBRG as being pro-republican as this\nimplied it was pro-IRA. He said that it was a community group which was more\nfocussed on social issues and met delegations from all communities. He also\nsaid that the first article was inaccurate to report that Mr Corbyn was the\nman’s MP – he said that the man did not live in Mr Corbyn’s constituency.\n9. With regards to the second article\nspecifically, the complainant said that it was inaccurate to report that the\nIrish in Islington Project shared offices with Mr Corbyn. He said that the\nProject had its own exclusive office, and many community projects were also\nbased in the same complex. He said that 131 St John’s Way – where the Irish in\nIslington Project was – was a different building from 129 St John’s Way where\nMr Corbyn held his surgeries. He said that this implied a link and closeness\nbetween Mr Corbyn and the Project which did not exist. The complainant said\nthat it was not the case that the Irish in Islington Project was a subsidiary\nof the IBRG – it was a separate organisation with a different constitution and\nemployed different people. He provided a cutting from a newspaper in 1983 which\nsaid: “Whereas the IBRG has taken the initiative in launching the exercise the\nproposed project [the Irish in Islington Project] will be independent of it.”\n10. He\nalso said that it was inaccurate to report that two men employed “set up an\noffice” as they began work at the Irish in Islington Project when the office\nspace had already been secured by others. The complainant said that it was\ninaccurate to describe the Irish in Greenwich Project as a “sister project” of\nthe Irish in Islington Project – there was no connection between the projects,\nand reporting that the Irish in Greenwich Project had been granted funding after\nthe 1984 conference implied that this had happened corruptly. The complainant\nsaid that it was not the case that the IBRG organised a press conference at the\nHouse of Commons after the Brighton bombings in 1984. He also said that the man\nwas not elected to be a councillor in Derry – he said that instead it was his\nunderstanding that he had been nominated to fill a vacancy between elections,\nand had never actually been elected.\n11. The\nnewspaper did not accept that the articles were inaccurate – it said that there\nwas nothing in either article which stated or implied corruption on the part of\nthe Irish in Islington Project by hiring the men over other candidates. It said\nthat it was accurate to report that when the Irish in Islington Project applied\nfor funding from the GLC in 1983, Mr Corbyn also wrote to the GLC to urge them\nto approve the application for two project workers. It provided a copy of this\nletter. When the application was granted, the posts were taken up by the man\nand another man – the roles were funded by the council. It said that as such,\nit was reasonable to say that the two men had Mr Corbyn to thank for their\njobs. It also said that the complainant was not in a position to dispute the\nrelationship and association between the man and Mr Corbyn. It said that it\ntook care to put claims to Mr Corbyn and did not receive a response or denial.\nIt said that it had not received a complaint from Mr Corbyn about the article,\nnor either of the men who took up the posts at the Project. The newspaper also\nreferred to a previous ruling by IPSO on a complaint made by one of the men who\ntook up the posts at the Project – he did not appear to challenge the assertion\nthat Mr Corbyn had lobbied the GLC to fund the Irish in Islington Project.\n12. The\nnewspaper said that it was able to demonstrate that the Project had applied to\nIslington Council for funding. It provided the original funding application\nsubmitted to the GLC in 1983, signed by the complainant. It highlighted that in\na section of the application asked what other sources of assistance had been\nsought, and it stated: “Outstanding application with Islington Council (race\nrelations) for office + full time worker”. It also provided a cutting from the\nIslington Gazette which reported that: “A community centre for the Irish in\nIslington is to go ahead. Members of Islington Council’s policy committee\nagreed to give it more than £68,000 in grants […]”. Furthermore, it also\nprovided an IBRG newsletter which said that:\n“Islington\nwhich so far has not spent a single penny on any Irish activity or organization\nin the borough has refused without providing any satisfactory explanation to\nfund community workers and premises that the Branch sought on behalf of the\nIrish in Islington Project.”\n13. The\nnewspaper said that describing the IBRG as “Corbyn’s IBRG” was to denote his\nheavy involvement and support of the organisation. It provided an IBRG election\nstatement which was solely devoted to Mr Corbyn and explained how valuable he\nwas to the organisation:\n“Jeremy\njoined the IBRG in the early days in November 1982, and since then has been an\nimmensely valuable and hard worker on our behalf. He enabled us to lobby\nIslington Council to provide the Irish Community with a research and advice\nworker along with office premises He is part of a delegation that the IBRG are\nsending along with an Islington Council delegation to the BBC, ITV, Home Office\nand Parliamentary Labour Party to lobby on matters affecting the Irish\ncommunity”.\nThe\nnewspaper noted that this election statement also set out that the IBRG had\nunanimously decided to publicly endorse Mr Corbyn, and to actively support his\nelection campaign. The newspaper also provided an IBRG statement which talked\nabout the branch’s activities from the previous year, which included:\n“…persuading Islington Council to call for the withdrawal of British troops\nfrom Ireland [and to] recognise the right of the Irish people to\nself-determination”.\n14. The\nnewspaper said that it was the man’s own claim that Mr Corbyn was his MP, and\nthe article reported this as a quote attributed to him. Although the newspaper\naccepted that the man’s home was not inside Mr Corbyn’s constituency, it\nprovided a Companies House document filed by the man in which he gave the Irish\nin Islington Project’s address – which was inside Mr Corbyn’s constituency – as\nhis home address. It said that he used this address for residential and\nbusiness purposes from 1984 to 1997.\n15. The\nnewspaper said that it was not inaccurate to say that that the Project “shared\noffices” with Mr Corbyn and noted that the article did not say that they shared\nan office. It said that the Project was based at 131 St John’s Way, and Mr\nCorbyn held surgeries at 129 St John’s Way – although these were separate\nbuildings, it said that at the time they were both part of the same complex and\nboth owned and used by the Council. Where they shared premises, it was not\ninaccurate to say that they “shared offices”. The newspaper said that\ndescribing the Project as a “subsidiary” of the IBRG did not have a legal or\ntechnical business meeting, and instead was to denote that the Project had\nstemmed from the IBRG. It provided a newsletter from the IBRG which said that\nthe Project was founded “as a result” of an Islington IBRG initiative and that\nthey were “instrumental in the establishment of the Irish in Islington\nProject”. It also provided a separate newsletter in which the Islington IBRG\nsaid that it had lobbied Islington Council “to provide the Irish Community with\na research and advice worker along with office premises” – it said that this\nwas a clear reference to the Project.\n16. The\nnewspaper said that saying that the two men “set up an office” did not mean\nthat they were responsible for finding premises or furnishing it. Instead it\nmeant that the two men started running the operations of the Project from that\noffice – which the complainant did not dispute. The newspaper said that it was\nnot the case that there was “no connection whatsoever” between the Irish in\nIslington Project and the Irish in Greenwich Project. It said that this point\nwas not significant in the context of the overall article, however describing\nthem as “sister projects” was to indicate that the organisations were very\nsimilar – both Projects supported the IBRG in their literature and campaigned\non the same issues. It also provided a flyer from 1987 from the Irish in\nIslington Project, which gave the Irish in Greenwich Project and a local IBRG\non a list of useful addresses. The newspaper provided a cutting of an article\npublished on 23 January 1985 which reported that the man “attended a press\nconference [the day before the article was published] organised by the Irish in\nBritain Representation Group”.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator.\niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n17. It\nwas not in dispute that Mr Corbyn had written to the GLC in support of the\nIrish in Islington Project’s funding application and specifically urged that\nthe application for two project workers be approved. It was clear that Mr\nCorbyn had taken active measures to aid the funding application for the two\nroles. The grant that was then awarded funded the two men’s jobs at the\nProject. As such, it was not misleading for either article to say that Mr\nCorbyn had helped create or promote the jobs, or that in doing so, this had\neffectively assisted the man. Similarly, the articles had a basis to say that\nthanks to “Corbyn and friends”, the man’s future was secure and that the man\nenjoyed a “charmed life, thanks in part to his friends [such as] Jeremy\nCorbyn”. The Committee noted that furthermore, both of these statements did not\nattribute the man’s success only to Mr Corbyn or anyone else.  The articles did not make any claim as to Mr\nCorbyn or anyone else’s involvement in hiring the man beyond supporting the\ncreation of the role. As such, the articles on these points were not misleading\nas to the process by which the men were hired by the complainant or the Irish\nin Islington Project, as suggested by the complainant. There was no failure to\ntake care in reporting Mr Corbyn’s role in the appointment of the man, and no\nbreach of Clause 1(i) or significant inaccuracy requiring correction under the\nterms of Clause 1(ii).\n18. Mr\nMcDonnell had written in support of an application by the project for capital\nfunding to set up a centre. Unlike with Mr Corbyn, it was not established that\nMr McDonnell had supported the specific application for the funding of the two\nproject workers. Nevertheless, the Committee did not consider that it was\nsignificantly inaccurate to make reference to a link between Mr McDonnell and\nthe financial support for the two job roles. Mr McDonnell had still advocated\nfor financial help to be given to the group; the nature of this help –capital\nfunding- was elsewhere referenced and, in any event, the article had been more\nfocused on the link between Mr Corbyn’s actions and the creation of the roles.\nThere was no failure to take care in reporting Mr McDonnell’s role in the\nappointment of the man, and no breach of Clause 1(i) or significant inaccuracy\nrequiring correction under the terms of Clause 1(ii).\n19.\nWhere the role was funded by the council, it was not misleading to describe it\nas a council job. There was no failure to take care over the accuracy in\nreporting the job role and no breach of Clause 1(i), and not significant\ninaccuracy requiring correction under the terms of Clause 1(ii).\n20. The\narticle reported that the Irish in Islington Project applied to Islington\nCouncil for funding for two full time staff and a headquarters. The complainant\ndid not appear to dispute that the Project was at times funded by Islington\nCouncil, specifically following the dissolution of the GLC. Where the article\ndid not make any claim that the Project applied to Islington Council for its\ninitial funding, the article was not inaccurate as suggested by the complainant\nto report that the Project had applied to Islington Council. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1(i) on this point, and no requirement for a correction under\nClause 1(ii).\n21. The\nphrase “Corbyn’s IBRG” was unclear– it was a minor reference in the context of\nthe article and did not claim that Mr Corbyn was responsible for the IBRG, or\nthat it operated under his leadership. Rather, it did suggest a close\nrelationship between Mr Corbyn and the organisation. The article explained that\nthe IBRG supported Mr Corbyn in his campaign to become an MP, and the newspaper\nwas able to show that the IBRG considered Mr Corbyn a strong supporter of the\nIBRG. The newspaper also said that it took care to put this claim to Mr Corbyn\nand did not receive any response. As such, it was not misleading to suggest a\nclose relationship between Mr Corbyn and the IBRG by referring to “Corbyn’s\nIBRG”. There was no breach of Clause 1(i) on this point and no requirement for\na correction under Clause 1(ii).\n22. The\narticle described the IBRG as being “pro-republican”, which the complainant was\nconcerned suggested that the group was aligned with the IRA. Although the\ncomplainant pointed out that the group had cross-community engagement, he did\nnot appear to dispute that it was pro-republican in its aims. Furthermore, a\nnewsletter provided by the newspaper reported that the Islington branch’s\nactivities included “…persuading Islington Council to call for the withdrawal\nof British troops from Ireland [and to] recognise the right of the Irish people\nto self-determination”. As such, it was not misleading to describe the group as\nbeing pro-republican. With regards to the complainant’s concern that this\ndescription linked the group to the IRA, the Committee was clear that\nrepublicanism and support for the IRA are distinct – the article did not make\nany suggestion that the IBRG was close to or supported the IRA in any way. As\nsuch, the article was not misleading to describe the group as pro-republican.\nThere was no breach of Clause 1(i) on this point, and no requirement for a\ncorrection under Clause 1(ii).\n23. The\nclaim that Mr Corbyn was the man’s MP was the man’s own claim, presented as a\nquote attributed to him. Clause 1(iv) requires that care is taken to\ndistinguish between comment, conjecture and fact – in this case, this care had\nbeen taken by attributing the claim to the man. There was no breach of Clause\n1(iv). It did not appear to be in dispute that the man did not live in Mr\nCorbyn’s constituency. However, the Committee noted that the man simply said\nthat Mr Corbyn was “his MP”, and the Committee considered that this description\nwas broad and could encompass the man considering that Mr Corbyn often acted on\nhis behalf in his role as an MP for example, or whether he felt he could count\non Mr Corbyn’s support – the complainant was not in a position to know whether\nthis was the man’s view. As such, the Committee did not find that the claim was\nsignificantly misleading as to the connection between Mr Corbyn and the man as\nto require correction under the terms of Clause 1(ii).\n24. The\nsecond article did not report that the Irish in Islington Project shared an\noffice with Mr Corbyn – instead it reported that the Project shared offices\n(plural) with Mr Corbyn, which the article explained was because the Project’s\noffice was in a community centre used by Mr Corbyn for his monthly community\nsurgeries. As such, the article was clear that the Project had its own office\nin the building and did not say that the Project and Mr Corbyn shared a single\nroom or office. The article did not make any claim that the Project and Mr\nCorbyn worked jointly at their respective premises. The Committee noted that\nthe Project was situated in a different building from where Mr Corbyn held his\nsurgeries, however it did not appear to be in dispute that both of these\nbuildings were adjacent and used for council-funded activities. As such, the\nCommittee considered that the article on this point was not significantly\nmisleading as to the connection between the Project and Mr Corbyn. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1(i), and no requirement for a correction under the terms of\nClause 1(ii).\n25. The\narticle reported that the Irish in Islington Project was a “subsidiary” of the\nIBRG. The Committee considered that “subsidiary” was not a prescriptive legal\nor technical business term in this context, and instead denoted that the\nProject was linked to the IBRG. The newspaper was able to demonstrate that it\nwas reported contemporaneously that the Project was formed at the instigation,\nand with the involvement, of the IBRG, which the complainant did not appear to\ndispute. In this case, this was a sufficient basis to describe the Project as a\n“subsidiary” of the IBRG. There was no failure to take over the accuracy of the\narticle in reporting this description. The complainant’s position that the Project\nwas separate and independent from the IBRG did not contradict this. As such,\nthe description did not represent a significant inaccuracy requiring correction\nunder the terms of Clause 1(ii).\n26. The\narticle reported that the two men “set up an office in a community centre in\nthe heart of Corbyn’s constituency”. It was not in dispute that the men began\nrunning the Project from the new premises. As such, the Committee considered\nthat whether the men were responsible for practically securing or furnishing\nthe office was not significant to the overall article; it did not affect the\ncentral point that the men began working at the recently-founded Project in\ncouncil buildings situated in Mr Corbyn’s constituency. There was no breach of\nClause 1 on this point.\n27. It\ndid not appear to be in dispute that both the Irish in Greenwich Project and\nthe Irish in Islington Project sought to support Irish communities in London.\nFurthermore, the article was not an in-depth focus on the Irish in Greenwich\nProject or its relationship with the Irish in Islington Project. As such, any\ndispute over the extent to which the Irish in Greenwich Project could\naccurately be described as a “sister project” was not significant to the\noverall article as to require correction under the terms of Clause 1(ii).\n28.  The complainant did not dispute that the\nIrish in Greenwich Project received funding after Mr Corbyn held a press event\nat the House of Commons. The newspaper was entitled to report that this had\noccurred, and the complainant was not in a position to dispute whether there\nhad been a causal link between the two events and the reasons for the local\ngovernment grant, especially as he had not been involved in the Irish in\nGreenwich Project. As such, the complainant was a third party on this point.\n29. The\narticle did not report that the man had been elected a councillor in Derry –\ninstead, it said that he had been a councillor in Northern Ireland. As such, it\ndid not appear to be in dispute that the man had been a councillor in Northern\nIreland, as reported by the article, and the article was not inaccurate or\nmisleading to report this fact. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\nConclusions\n30. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n31.
