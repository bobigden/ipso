Sue Storey complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that The Herald (Didcot) breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 4\n(Intrusion into grief or shock) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “SCHOOLBOY FOUND HANGED” published on 13 March 2019.\n2. The article, which appeared on the front page, reported\non the opening of the inquest into the death of a 13 year old child. It\nincluded a quotation from the coroner which said that the child had a\n“previously well-known mental health history”. The article included a\nphotograph of the child at a school sports event.\n3. The article appeared online in much the same form with\nthe headline “Inquest opens into death of Didcot schoolboy Harry Storey.” This\narticle did not report that the coroner had told the inquest that the child had\na “previously well-known mental health history”, but instead that the child had\n“previously no known mental health history”.\n4. The complainant, the mother of the child who died, said\nthat the article inaccurately reported that her child had a “previously\nwell-known mental health history”. While not present at the inquest, she said\nher child had no mental health issues, and reporting this had caused her and\nher family much distress. During IPSO’s investigation, the complainant said\nthat coroner had confirmed that he had in fact said that her son had “no known\nmental health history”, and provided a recording of the proceedings to show\nthis. The complainant also said that the article breached Clause 4. She said\nthat the prominent headline and photograph of her child was inappropriate and\nunnecessary, and had not been published with her knowledge or consent. She also\nsaid that details of how her son had died had not been communicated to teachers\nor students at the school; by publishing these details in the article, it had\ncaused her and her family much distress.\n5. The publication apologised for the distress caused. It\nsaid that it was contacted directly by the complainant in relation to the\narticle. At this point, in the absence of the recording of the inquest, the\npublication maintained that the article was accurate because it was reflective\nof the notes taken by the journalist during proceedings, and had been\ncorroborated in writing by a second journalist from another news outlet.\nHowever, it recognised the distress caused by the quote, and printed the\ncorrection and apology set out below in the next edition on its front and\nsecond page. Furthermore, when it was provided with a recording of the inquest\nduring IPSO’s investigation, it accepted that the reporter had misheard what\nthe coroner had said. However it said that the action it had taken at the time\nof the direct approach was sufficient under the terms of Clause 1(ii).\nFront page correction:\n“Harry inquest correction\nOn the front page of last week’s Herald (March 13), we\nreported on the inquest opening for Harry Storey. The report incorrectly stated\nthat Harry had a “well-known mental health history”.”\nPage 2 continuation:\n“Inquest correction\nOn the front page of last week’s Herald, we reported the\nHarry Storey inquest opening. The report incorrectly stated that Harry had a\n“well-known mental health history”. The statement from the coroner was, in\nfact, that Harry had “no known mental health history”. We apologise for this\nmistake and distress caused to Harry’s family and friends. They would like us\nto point out that Harry was a cheerful young man and talented sportsman.\nHarry’s family are asking for donations, in lieu of flowers, to the Paediatric\nIntensive Care Unit at John Radcliffe Hospital, which cared for Harry.\nDonations can be made to [Named Funeral Service] on [Telephone number] or via\n[email address]. If you need someone to talk to, Samaritans helpline is open\n24/7. Call 116 123 or email jo@samaritans.org.”\n6. The complainant did not accept this offer of correction.\nShe said that it should apologise for the overall reporting of her son’s death,\nand should have appeared in full on the front page, rather than being continued\non page two.\n7. The publication did not accept that the article’s\npublication had been handled insensitively. It said that it was entitled to\nreport on inquest proceedings and there was a significant public interest in\nthis particular case. It said that it did not make any direct approaches to the\nfamily but instead had contacted the police and the school to inform them that\nthe article would be published, and to ask whether the parents would like to\nspeak. It also said that following the article, it had ensured that there was\nadditional training for staff in relation to the reporting of suicide, and\ncases involving children. It said that it had contacted the school in relation\nto the photograph of the child, which it had taken at a previous sports event.\nThe school did not respond to say that it, or the family, did not want the\nphotograph to be published. It said that the only time it had named Harry was\nwhen the inquest opened and his details were publicly available.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n8. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\n9. Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings.\nFindings of the Committee\n10. The Committee first wished to express its condolences to\nthe complainant and her family for the tragic loss of her son.\n11. Although the article had accurately reported the\ncontemporaneous notes taken at the inquest, these notes had inaccurately recorded\nwhat was said by the coroner; this was a breach of Clause 1(i). In the context\nof an inquest report, inaccurately reporting the circumstances of a person’s\ndeath and the possible contributing medical causes constituted a significant\ninaccuracy and required correction under the terms of Clause 1(ii). The\ninaccuracy did not appear in the online version of the article.\n12. Following the complainant’s direct approach to the\nnewspaper, the correction was published in the next edition of the newspaper\nafter the original article was published. This was sufficiently prompt. The\nwording of this correction clearly set out the inaccuracy, the correct\nposition, and apologised to the family for the mistake and the distress caused.\nAlthough not a requirement of Clause 1(ii), the Committee welcomed the extra\nsteps the publication had taken in response to the sensitive nature of the\ninaccuracy: printing a tribute from the family to the child; pointing readers\nto the family’s requests for funeral arrangements; and including contact\ndetails for the Samaritans. In considering whether the correction was\nsufficiently prominent, the Committee had regard for the fact that the\nplacement of any remedial action must be proportional to the original placement\nand seriousness of the breach. In this case, the article appeared on the front\npage and then on page two – the inaccuracy appeared on the front page. The\ncorrection which was published appeared on both the front page and page two;\nthe part of the correction which appeared on the front page made clear that the\nstatement was inaccurate and the continuation on page two made clear the\ncorrect position and apologised for the mistake and the distress caused. For\nthese reasons, and in acknowledgement of the prompt and comprehensive nature of\nthe correction, the Committee considered that the correction was sufficiently\nprompt and there was no breach of Clause 1(ii).\n13. Deaths affect whole communities as well as the immediate\nfamily, and there is often widespread interest in the circumstances of a death,\nparticularly in the sudden death of a child. Although the Committee recognised\nthat the complainant had found the publication of the article to be\ndistressing, the terms of Clause 4 specify that its provisions should not restrict\nthe right to report legal proceedings. In this case, the article was an inquest\nreport, and did not mock or ridicule the complainant’s son, or go beyond what\nwas heard at proceedings. The photograph of the child simply showed him at a\nschool sports events, and at the time of publication, his name and information\nabout his death was in the public domain via the inquest proceedings. The\npublication had also had permission to use this photograph from their reporting\nof a previous event and they had informed both the school and police liaison\nthat it would be used in order for them to tell the family so they would not be\nsurprised when it was published. As such, reporting this information did not\nconstitute a breach of Clause 4.\nConclusion\n14. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1(i)\nRemedial Action Required\n15. The Committee found that the correction previously\nprinted by the publication was sufficient to correct the significant\ninaccuracies and no further action needed to be taken.\n\nDate complaint received: 14/07/2019\nDate complaint concluded: 28/02/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
