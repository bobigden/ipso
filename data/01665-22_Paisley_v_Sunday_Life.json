Denis\nPaisley complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the\nSunday Life breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3\n(Harassment) and Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge) of the Editors’\nCode of Practice in an article headlined “BOOKIES GUN LOYALIST HAS STORMONT\nFUNDED JOB”, published on 13 February 2022.\n2. The\narticle appeared on the front page and continued on pages four and five. It\nreported on the publication of a recent Police Ombudsman report which\nconsidered the investigations by police into a number of attacks, including one\nat the Sean Graham bookmakers in 1992. The article focused on the complainant\nwho the publication believed featured heavily in the report, under a cipher,\ndetailing his previous conviction for possessing a weapon used in the incident.\nFollowing the publication of the Ombudsman report, the newspaper approached the\ncomplainant at his home for comment and took a photograph of him; this image\nwas cropped to show the complainant’s head and bare shoulders and was published\nboth on the front page and again alongside the article in the inside pages.\n3. The\ntext on the front page stated: “The ex-UDA man caught with a gun used in the\nOrmeau Road bookies massacre has refused to apologise to the victims’\nfamilies”. The article further stated that the complainant had “refused to\napologise to the victims’ families”; “When approached at his Lisburn home last\nweek, Paisley refused to answer when our reporter asked if he would apologise\nto the families of the Sean Graham victims”; “Paisley also refused to answer\nany questions regarding his possession of the Browning or what he intended to\nuse it for on the day that he was caught”. An image caption said “SNUB: Denis\nPaisley refused to speak to us”.\n4. The\narticle included an additional image of the complainant which showed him at his\nworkplace. It also reported that the complainant “is referred to as the cipher\n‘ZZ’ in the [Police Ombudsman] report” and that “There is no suggestion Paisley\nused the gun [in the incident].” The article stated that the complainant “was\njailed for seven years for possessing the weapon, [and] was suspected by police\nof being en route to kill a Catholic man at a Lisburn factory.” It also quoted\nan “insider” who said: “Denis was in his early 20s and was part of a group of\nyoung loyalists Alex Kerr wanted blooded as future killers.”\n5. The\narticle also appeared online in substantially the same format under the\nheadline “Loyalist caught with Belfast bookies massacre gun has Stormont-funded\njob”.\n6. The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 as it\nstated that he refused to answer questions and apologise to the victims of the\nOrmeau Road atrocity. He said this was untrue as the reporter had not asked\nthose questions and was at his door for less than a minute and would not have\nhad the time to ask everything that was stated in the article. He stated that\nhe had never been asked to apologise for the Ormeau Road atrocity prior to the\napproach from the journalist, as his conviction for possession of the weapon\nwas nothing to do with the Ormeau Road incident.\n7. The\ncomplainant also said that the article inaccurately claimed that when he was\narrested, he “was suspected by police of being en route to kill a Catholic man\nat a Lisburn factory.” The complainant said this was a fabrication which could\nbe verified by the police as he was never questioned about such activity. He\nsaid the Relatives for Justice (RFJ) report, which the publication appeared to\nhave relied on, was “unofficial and steeped with non-factual information” and\nthe claim amounted to speculation, not fact. The complainant further disputed\nthe claim in the article that “’Denis was in his early 20s and was part of a\ngroup of young loyalists Alex Kerr wanted blooded as future killers,’ said an\ninsider”, as he said he did know Alex Kerr or recognise the image of him in the\narticle.\n8. The\ncomplainant also said the article breached Clause 2 as he considered the\napproach by the publication to be intrusive and an invasion of his privacy. He\nhad been unaware that a photographer was present and had not consented to the\nphotograph being taken, and he considered that the act of taking the photograph\nat his home was an intrusion into his privacy, particularly as he was partially\nclothed at the time the photograph was taken. He also considered that\npublishing details of his previous conviction, as well as linking him and the\ncharity he worked for to the atrocities of the past to which he was\nunconnected, amounted to a breach of his privacy.\n9. The\ncomplainant also complained under Clause 3, as he said the journalist had\nshouted questions at him and gave him no opportunity to respond; he believed\nthe real motive for the approach was to obtain the photograph of him. He said\nthis approach had harassed his family and caused undue hardship. He provided an\naccount of the exchange with the journalist and said the conversation ended\nwhen he made clear he did not wish to comment, either directly or through a\nsolicitor, and then closed the door.\n10. The\ncomplainant also said that the publication had breached Clause 10, as he had\nnot been informed of the journalist’s visit to his house or that a photographer\nwould be taking a picture of him, without his knowledge or consent, for\npublication.\n11. The\npublication denied any breach of the Editors’ Code. It said the journalist had\nrecorded the exchange at the doorstep – which had lasted for one and a half\nminutes – for accuracy purposes, and the recording, a copy of which it provided\nto IPSO, demonstrated the journalist was polite and gave the complainant an\nopportunity to respond to his questions. The publication said the journalist\nhad given the complainant ample opportunity to apologise for his association\nwith the incident, or to sympathise with the families of the victims, but\ninstead he had repeated that he did not wish to say anything. The publication\nprovided the journalist’s account of the conversation:\nFrom\nthe date and time information attached to the recording of the doorstep\nconversation I can confirm it took place at Mr Paisley's home address at 8.50am\non February 11. Not as Mr Paisley states 8.30am.\nWe\nspoke on his doorstep for approximately 1 minute and 26 seconds. Contrary to Mr\nPaisley's recollection, I did not shout the questions at him but spoke at a\nnormal conversational level. \nI\nintroduced myself and began saying I wished to speak to him about his\nconviction for possession of the Browning 9mm pistol used in the Ormeau Road\nbookie's massacre. \nHe\nreplied: \"I have no interest in talking to you.\"\nI\nthen asked him if he had anything to say to the massacre victims’ families\nfollowing the publication of the Police Ombudsman's report into the killings.\nHe\nreplied: \"I have absolutely nothing to say to anybody, other than my\nsolicitor if needs be.\"\nI\nasked him the name of his solicitor but he told me it was \"none of my\nbusiness\".\nI\nthen asked him again if he had anything to say about his conviction for\npossession of the Browning or to the victims' families.\nHe\nreplied: \"I certainly have nothing to say to you or to anybody else.\"\nI\nthen asked him what he was doing with the gun on the day he was arrested and if\nhe was on his way to murder someone.\nHe\nreplied: \"See you later.\"\nI\nalso offered him the opportunity to take my business card and the chance to\nspeak about the matter over the telephone but he declined.\nAt\nthe end of our exchange I thanked him for his time and left.\n12. The\npublication also denied that it had breached Clause 1 in relation to the claim\nthat the complainant had been suspected by police of being en route to kill a\nCatholic person at the time of his arrest. It said it had received this\ninformation from well-placed sources who had access to documents including\nnotes of the interview between the complainant and the police at the time of\nhis arrest. It also said that this was documented in the RFJ report – a report\ncompiled from evidence gathered from a variety of sources.\n13. The\npublication provided excerpts from the report which it said supported its\nposition: the report suggested that the pistol used in the Sean Graham's attack\nwas recovered from a van, \"carrying two men who, it is believed, were on\nthe way to carry out an attack. […] The two men arrested were Denis Paisley,\nthe driver, and his passenger Andrew Webb.” And “it is clear that both Paisley\nand Webb were scouting the Radication Factory on Church Road, Lambeg. […] It is\ngenerally thought that a Catholic member of the workforce at Radication were to\nhave been targeted. It also appears that the van may have been under\nsurveillance as it is mentioned in interview that they had slowed and observed\nthe factory, which was several miles from where they were eventually stopped.”\nThe publication further stated that the reporter had viewed police documents\nwhich indicated that police suspected the complainant was planning to shoot a\nCatholic worker at the factory and that he was questioned by police about that.\n14. The\npublication also believed the complainant was identifiable as “Person ZZ” in\nthe Ombudsman report given the information available in the public domain\nfollowing the publication of the RFJ report, and information the publication\nreceived from trusted confidential sources. It also said that the complainant\nhad been named in connection with the Ormeau Road incident by another\npublication on 8 February 2022. The publication provided excerpts about “Person\nZZ” from the Ombudsman report which said they had been questioned about the\nOrmeau Road incident at the time of their arrest.\n15. In\nregard to the complainant’s denial that Alex Kerr wanted him to be “blooded” as\na UDA killer as reported in the article, the publication said that this\ninformation had been provided by its well-placed loyalist sources.  It did not believe the complainant’s claim\nthat he had never heard of Mr Kerr as, it said, he was a commanding officer in\nthe UDA, and well known to the public at large at the time.\n16. In\naddition, the publication did not accept a breach of Clause 2. It stated that\nthe complainant’s past conviction was a matter of public record, and in light\nof the Ombudsman's report, it considered there was a public interest in\nidentifying a person convicted of possessing one of the weapons involved in the\nOrmeau Road incident and giving them the opportunity to comment. The\npublication said that it did not expect the complainant to answer the door\nbare-chested but, in any event, said he was clearly comfortable opening the\ndoor to a stranger while partially dressed and was in full view of anyone passing\nby. The publication said that this approach had not intruded into his private\nlife, nor was he engaged in a private act, and would have known that he was in\npublic view to anyone on the street.\n17. The\npublication said, prior to publication of the article, the editor and senior\nstaff had discussed whether to use the photograph of the complainant and had\ndecided to crop the image to display only his head and shoulders. It considered\nthat the publication of a cropped image of the complainant to illustrate that\nhe had refused to comment about his connection to the Ormeau Road incident, to\nbe relevant to the subject matter of the article. It did not consider that the\nimage disclosed any private information about the complainant, but simply\nshowed his likeness. It said doorstepping the complainant and using the photo\nwas in keeping with the public interest.\n18. The\npublication did not accept that there had been a breach of Clause 3 as it said\nthe reporter had not engaged in intimidation, harassment, or persistent pursuit\nnor that he had shouted questions at the complainant. It provided a recording\nand transcript to support its position. Since the complainant had been\nidentified in the Ombudsman’s report issued a few days prior, as well as being\nnamed in the RFJ report, and in light of further information received from the\npublication’s sources, the reporter was justified in approaching the\ncomplainant for comment.\n19. The\npublication did not accept a breach of Clause 10, as it said while the complainant\nmay not have noticed the photographer, he was sitting in a car directly across\nthe street from the complainant’s home in clear view and had not engaged in\nmisrepresentation or subterfuge, and the camera was not “hidden”.\n20.\nWhile the publication did not accept a breach of the Code, it offered to print\nthe complainant’s denials and also to publish his comments on the Ormeau Road\nincident.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished.

In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy, account will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of\ninformation and the extent to which the material complained about is already in\nthe public domain or will become so.\niii) It\nis unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or\nprivate places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nClause 3\n(Harassment)\ni)\nJournalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit.\nii) They\nmust not persist in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing\nindividuals once asked to desist; nor remain on property when asked to leave\nand must not follow them.

The\npublic interest includes, but is not confined to:\n-\nDetecting or exposing crime, or the threat of crime, or serious impropriety.\n- Protecting\npublic health or safety.\n- Protecting\nthe public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or\norganisation.\n- Disclosing\na person or organisation’s failure or likely failure to comply with any\nobligation to which they are subject.\n- Disclosing\na miscarriage of justice.\n- Raising\nor contributing to a matter of public debate, including serious cases of\nimpropriety, unethical conduct or incompetence concerning the public.\n- Disclosing\nconcealment, or likely concealment, of any of the above.\n(2.)\nThere is a public interest in freedom of expression itself.\n(3.) The\nregulator will consider the extent to which material is already in the public\ndomain or will become so.\n(4.)\nEditors invoking the public interest will need to demonstrate that they\nreasonably believed publication - or journalistic activity taken with a view to\npublication – would both serve, and be proportionate to, the public interest\nand explain how they reached that decision at the time.\n(5.) An\nexceptional public interest would need to be demonstrated to over-ride the\nnormally paramount interests of children under 16.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n21. The\narticle claimed that “The ex-UDA man caught with a gun used in the Ormeau Road\nbookies massacre [the complainant] has refused to apologise to the victims’\nfamilies”. The recording of the exchange between the complainant and the\njournalist confirmed that the journalist had asked whether the complainant had\nanything to say to the families of the victims, to which the complainant had\nsaid he had no comment. The journalist did not ask, expressly, whether he\nwished to apologise to the families and, therefore, it was inaccurate to report\nthat the complainant had refused to apologise. The distinction between\ndeclining to provide a comment and refusing to apologise was significant given\nthat it might be construed as indicating the complainant’s attitude toward the\nfamilies of the victims and the incident more generally. Misreporting the\nexchange between the journalist and the complainant, particularly when a\nrecording was available, amounted to a failure to take care not to publish\ninaccurate information in breach of Clause 1 (i). As the inaccuracy was\nsignificant and the newspaper had not offered to publish a correction, there\nwas a further breach of Clause 1 (ii).\n22. The\narticle also claimed that at the time of the complainant’s arrest for\npossession of a weapon, he was suspected by police to have been on his way to\nkill a Catholic person, which the complainant denied.  The publication said that it had relied on\nseveral sources in support of this claim, including the passages from the RFJ\nreport, as summarised in paragraph 13 above, and police documents which it said\nhad been obtained by the victims’ families which it said it had seen. The\npublication had also invited the complainant to comment on the allegation\nbefore publication of the article. The publication had, therefore, taken care\nnot to publish inaccurate information on this point. The article reported only\nthat this had been a suspicion held by the police, from which it was clear that\nthe claim was not being reported as fact. As such, there was no breach of\nClause 1 on this point.\n23.\nTurning to the complainant’s concerns about whether an “insider” had said:\n“Denis was in his early 20s and was part of a group of young loyalists Alex\nKerr wanted blooded as future killers.” The Editors’ Code of Practice makes\nclear the press has the right to publish individuals’ views, as long as it\ntakes care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information, and\nto distinguish between comment, conjecture and fact. The claim was clearly\ndistinguished as comment and attributed to the “insider”, rather than being\nreported as fact. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n24. The\nCommittee then considered whether the newspaper’s approach to the complainant\non his doorstep and the published cropped image breached Clause 2. The\nCommittee emphasised that the terms of Clause 2 do not prohibit journalists\nfrom approaching people unannounced at their homes. The Committee accepted\nthat, in certain circumstances, an individual may have a reasonable expectation\nof privacy while standing in his/her front doorway. In this case, following the\npublication of the Police Ombudsman report – which the publication believed\nidentified the complainant 19 times – the Committee accepted that it was in the\npublic interest to capture the complainant’s reaction when approached for\ncomment, and photographing the complainant in these circumstances was\njustified. In addition, the photograph did not reveal anything private about\nthe complainant; the publication had taken care to crop the image so that it\nshowed only his head and shoulders. There was no breach of Clause 2.\n25. In\nregard to the complainant’s concerns that publishing information about his\nprevious conviction intruded into his private life, the newspaper was entitled\nto publish information about the complainant’s previous conviction which was in\nthe public domain. The Committee considered the complainant’s concerns that\nlinking the Ormeau Road incident to the charity he worked for breached Clause\n2, however, in this case, where the charity was not an individual and the\ncomplainant’s spent conviction was not private information, there was no breach\nof Clause 2 on these points.\n26. In\nregard to concerns raised under Clause 3, newspapers are generally entitled to\napproach people for comment at their homes. Having reviewed the recording of\nthe exchange, it found that the journalist identified himself, asked the\ncomplainant questions in a polite manner and left once the complainant made\nclear he did not wish to make comments. Where the journalist had not engaged in\nintimidating or persistent questioning, there was no breach of Clause 3.\n27.\nWhile the Committee appreciated the complainant had not seen the photographer,\nbased upon the information provided by the publication which had not been\nchallenged by the complainant, the Committee did not find that the camera was\nhidden or that the photographer had engaged in misrepresentation or subterfuge\nin circumstances where the photographs were taken from a car parked on the\npublic street. For this reason, there was no breach of Clause 10.\nConclusion(s)\n28. The\ncomplaint was upheld in part under Clause 1. \nRemedial\nAction Required\n29. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1 (i) and\nClause 1 (ii), the Committee considered what remedial action should be\nrequired. In circumstances where the Committee establishes a breach of the\nEditors’ Code, it can require the publication of a correction and/or an\nadjudication, the terms and placement of which is determined by IPSO.\n30. The\nCommittee had found that the publication did not take the necessary care when\nreporting the complainant’s response to the journalist and that the distinction\nbetween the complainant refusing to apologise to the victims’ families and\nrefusing an opportunity to give any message to the victims’ families was\nsignificant. Notwithstanding this finding, it remained the case that the\ncomplainant had declined an opportunity to comment to the families, and in\nthese circumstances, the Committee considered that the appropriate remedy was\nthe publication of a correction to make clear the precise nature of the\nexchange. The inaccurate claim had appeared online and in print; the claim\nappeared on the front page as well as being repeated later in the article. In\nthese circumstances, the correction must be published both on the online\narticle and in print.\n31. Where the inaccuracy was found on the front\npage and on pages four and five, and taking into account the nature and extent\nof the inaccuracy, the Committee concluded that the correction should be\npublished on page two of the print newspaper and at the foot of the online\narticle. If the publication intends to continue to publish the online article\nwithout further amendment, the correction on the article should be published\nimmediately beneath the headline. The wording of the correction should be\nagreed with IPSO in advance and should make clear that it has been published\nfollowing an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation.\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 16/02/2022\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 05/07/2022\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
