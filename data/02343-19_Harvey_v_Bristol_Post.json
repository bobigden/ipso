Francis Harvey\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Bristol\nPost breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Growing Pride as celebration moves home”, published on 4\nMarch 2019\n2. The article\nreported that Bristol Pride celebrations were relocating following an increase\nin popularity. It reported that the event had grown “in the ten years since it\nbegan”, when the celebrations originally featured a march through the city centre\nending with a festival on College Green. However, the article said that it had\nsince moved to a bigger venue, and last year took over the Millennium Square as\nwell. It quoted the CEO of Bristol Pride, who said “It’s been an incredible ten\nyears”.\n3. The article\nappeared online under the headline “Bristol Pride moving to new site and will\ndouble in size”, published on 1 March 2019. It was longer than the print\narticle, and went into detail about the acts which were booked to perform at\nthis year’s festival and about the event’s sponsors. This article also stated\nthat “This year is the tenth anniversary for the current Pride team”.\n4. The complainant\nsaid that it was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) to report that\nBristol Pride was only ten years old. He said that in fact, smaller gay pride\nfestivals or events had occurred in Bristol in previous decades; for this\nreason, it was also inaccurate to describe the man quoted in the article as the\nevent’s founder. The complainant said that sources first mentioned a Bristol\nPride occurring in the summer of 1977, and this was revived in 1992. He said\nthat there was also a Bristol Mardi Gras (Pride) festival which folded in 2007,\nand provided a photograph of an event held in 2005\n5. The complainant also said that nevertheless,\n2019 was the 9th rather that the 10th anniversary of the current Bristol Pride\ncelebrations, as the first revamped festival occurred in 2010. He also said\nthat for the past 9 years, the event was usually held in Castle Park and only\ntook place on College Green in 2012, and 2018 was not the first time it spread\nto Millennium Square.\n6. The publication\ndid not accept that the article was inaccurate. It said that the article was\nbased on Bristol Pride’s own website, which said “It’s our 10th anniversary and\nwe’ve got big plans”. It said that the online article made clear that this was\nthe 10th anniversary for the current team, and on receipt of the complaint, the\npublication contacted the CEO of Bristol Pride, who confirmed that this was the\ncase, and his team were not claiming to celebrate any anniversary of the\nbeginning of LGBT movements in Bristol. Nevertheless, he said that the 1977\nevent was in protest at a blasphemy trial, and although it reflected pride in\ngay identity, it was not widely known as a Pride event and subsequent events\nand festivals were ad hoc and irregular; although various LGBT venues had\norganised events, there was no central city-wide Pride until the current team’s\ninvolvement in 2009, and the festival in 2010. In addition, he said that there\nwas no one definition or trademark for Pride, and his team had never claimed\nexclusive ownership of the term.\n7. The publication\naccepted that the print version of the article omitted the sentence “for the\ncurrent Pride team” but did not accept that this represented a significant\ninaccuracy. However, it offered to print the following clarification on page 2\nof the print edition of the publication, as a gesture of goodwill, in\nresolution of the complaint. This was rejected by the complainant.\n“Our article ‘Growing Pride as celebration moves home’\npublished on 4 March 2019, reported that the festival will be celebrating its\n10th anniversary this year between 29 Jun and 14 July. We are happy to clarify\nthat this celebration marks the 10th anniversary of the festival as run by its\ncurrent organisers.”\nRelevant Code Provisions\n8. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator.\niii) A fair\nopportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n9. The Committee\nrecognised that the term Pride is used to denote a wide range of events and\ncelebrations; in this case, the article was referring to the organisation named\nBristol Pride, which was celebrating its 10th anniversary. The question for the\nCommittee was whether the article took care to avoid giving the misleading\nimpression that this organisation’s celebrations marked the beginning of all\nLGBT festivities in Bristol.\n10.  In this case, the\narticle was entitled to report Bristol Pride’s claim that it was celebrating\nits 10th anniversary, and took care not to give any misleading impression that\nthe celebrations representing an anniversary of all Pride-related activities in\nBristol; the article referred to “the Bristol Pride celebration” as an event\nand single entity, and quoted its CEO. The article did not give any misleading\nimpression that Bristol Pride denoted all LGBT events in Bristol and it was not\nmisleading or inaccurate to describe the CEO of Bristol Pride as its “founder”.\nIn addition, the Committee noted that the online version referred to the 10th\nanniversary as one for “the current Pride team”. There was no breach of Clause\n1(i), and no inaccuracies requiring correction under Clause 1(ii).\n11. The article had accurately reported Bristol Pride’s own\nwebsite which said that it was celebrating its 10th anniversary, and so there\nwas no breach of Clause 1(i). Furthermore, where it was not in dispute that\nthis was the 10th event since the first celebration in 2009, or that Bristol\nPride had relocated due to its expansion after occupying various sites around\nBristol, any inaccuracy on these points did not create any significantly\nmisleading impression of the overall story, and thus did not require correction\nunder Clause 1(ii).\nConclusions\n12. The complaint was not upheld\nRemedial Action Required\n13. N/A\nDate complaint received by IPSO: 12/03/2019\nDate complaint issued: 10/05/2019\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer\nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
