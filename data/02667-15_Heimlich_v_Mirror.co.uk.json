Peter Heimlich complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that Mirror.co.uk had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Dog stops pensioner from\nchoking to death on pickled onion with 'Heimlich Manoeuvre', published on 1\nApril 2015. \n2. The article reported that a dog had stopped a man from\nchoking to death by carrying out the “Heimlich manoeuvre”. \n3. The complainant said the Heimlich manoeuvre was a\nfirst aid procedure for dislodging an obstruction from a person’s windpipe by\napplying a sudden strong pressure to the abdomen. He said the article had\nstated that the dog had jumped onto its owner’s back; as such, he had performed\nback blows, not the Heimlich manoeuvre. The newspaper had amended the article,\nbut it would not append a note stating that a correction had been made, and it\nwould not apologise for the inaccuracy. \n4. The newspaper said the story about a dog carrying out\na “canine version of the Heimlich manoeuvre” was clearly light-hearted. The\narticle was amended as a gesture of good will, not because the newspaper\nconsidered that the reference to the Heimlich manoeuvre was significantly\nmisleading.  \nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving the\nRegulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance. \nFindings of the Committee\n6. The article was a light, heart-warming account of a\ndog saving the life of its owner. It had clearly described the dog’s actions.\nThe humorous reference to the “canine version” of the Heimlich manoeuvre had\nnot created a significantly misleading impression of how the Heimlich manoeuvre\nis performed. The complaint under Clause 1 was not upheld. \nConclusions\n7. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 13/04/2015\nDate decision issued:\n22/05/2015\n\n\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
