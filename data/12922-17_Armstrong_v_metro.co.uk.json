Katharine\nArmstrong complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nmetro.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2 (Privacy) of the Editors’\nCode of Practice in an article headlined “Revealed: The man who refused to let\nterrorists ruin his pint”, published on 5 June 2017.\n2. The article\nreported on speculation surrounding the identity of a man who was photographed\nfollowing the London Bridge terror attack, holding a pint, amongst a crowd of\npeople who were fleeing the incident. The article said that “according to a\nFacebook post shared by a relative, and reported by the Liverpool Echo, [the\nman] genuinely did take his pint with him because of how expensive drinks are\nin London”. The article quoted from the Facebook post: “So that guy with the\npint? Yes, that’s the elusive [name]. That’s what happens when you’re a Scouser\npaying London pint prices.’ The article did not name the author of this post.\n3. The complainant,\nthe sister of the man pictured and the author of the Facebook post, expressed\nsignificant concern that her comments, which she had published on her Facebook\naccount, had been published in the article. She said that she had not shared\nher comments publicly: her Facebook privacy settings had meant that her post\nwould have been visible to many of her Facebook friends, as well as,\npotentially, the friends of the seven people that she had “tagged” in the post.\nHowever, the complainant explained that not all of the individuals outside of\nher Facebook network would have been able to view her post, as not all of the\npeople she had “tagged” had approved the post to be visible on their timeline.\nThe complainant accepted, however, that it was possible that up to 1358 people\nmay have been able to view it.\n4. The complainant\nfurther said that when she had seen the photograph circulating on social media\nand had then published her Facebook post, she had been speculating on the\nidentity of the man pictured. While the publication had reported her post\naccurately, no further steps were taken by the newspaper to establish the\nveracity of her claims.\n5. The publication\ndid not accept that the publication of the comments which the complainant had\nmade on Facebook, represented an intrusion into her privacy, or that there had\nbeen a failure to take care over the accuracy of the article. It said that the\ncomplainant had published her post on social media, and had tagged friends in\norder to publicise it: there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in\nrespect of a post which would have been seen by individuals both inside and\noutside her friendship network. It further said that after the story had been\nreported in other publications, it had reported the complainant’s post\naccurately; care was also taken to ensure the article had made clear that the\nman’s identity had been revealed “according” to a Facebook post by a family\nmember.\nRelevant Code provisions\n6.    Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2 (Privacy)*\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nFindings of the Committee\n7. The Committee recognised\nthe importance of reporting on the immediate aftermath of a terror attack in a\nsensitive manner and acknowledged the complainant’s concern about the\npublication of the information relating to her Facebook post. In considering\nwhether the complainant had a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to\nthis information, the Committee carefully analysed the nature of the\ninformation which had been published about her, and the extent of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosure of that information.\n8. The article had\nreported the complainant’s comments, which had identified her brother’s name\nand which had conveyed her humorous explanation of his apparent reaction to the\nincident. The fact that the complainant’s brother was, or appeared to be, the\nperson photographed, was not private information about her; the information\nabout her was limited to the nature of her comments and the fact of her\nidentification of him. The article had not named the complainant as the author\nof these comments, nor had the article identified the relationship between her\nand her brother.\n9. The Committee\nalso considered the manner in which the information contained in the article\nhad been obtained. The Committee noted the complainant’s position that she had\nprivacy settings in place on her Facebook at the time the article was\npublished. However, those settings had made the post visible to many of the\ncomplainant’s Facebook friends, as well as, potentially, the friends of the\nseven people she had “tagged” in her post, one of whom had been a journalist\nfor another publication, who had first brought it to public attention.\nFurthermore, the article had made clear that its report had been based on\ninformation which had been published in the other newspaper: the publication\nhad not sourced the information in a manner which had intruded into the\ncomplainant’s privacy.\n10. Taking account the nature of the information and the\nmanner in which it had been previously circulated, the Committee concluded that\nthe complainant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy in relation to\nthis information; nor did its publication in the article under complaint\nrepresent an intrusion into her private life. There was no breach of Clause 2.\n11. The publication had accurately reported the\ncomplainant’s Facebook post; in those circumstances, and where the article had\nmade clear that this information had been sourced from claims made in another\npublication, there was no failure to take care over the accuracy of the\narticle. There was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusion\n12. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial action required13.
