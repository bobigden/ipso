Colin Robertson complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that sun.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2\n(Privacy) and Clause 3 (Harassment) in an article headlined “VILE VLOGGER\nRacist who polluted YouTube with ­hate-filled videos unmasked as jobless\nScottish student who lives with his dad”, published on 9 January 2017.\n2. The article reported that the identity of the\ncomplainant, an online blogger who had published videos on his YouTube channel,\n“Millennial Woes”, had been revealed, after he had addressed a conference at\nthe National Policy Institute in Washington DC. The article referred to the\ncomplainant, and his videos, as “racist”, “vile”, “hate filled” and promoting\n“hatred of black people, Jews and women”. \n3. The complainant expressed concern that the article had\ninaccurately referred to him as “racist”. He said that the newspaper’s\ncharacterisation of his videos as “vile” was inaccurate, because the material\ncontained within them was innocuous. The complainant said that in those\ncircumstances, it was inaccurate for the articles to report that he was\n“hateful”, or that his YouTube videos were “hate-filled”.\n4. The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. The\npublication provided a number of links to a selection of videos which the\ncomplainant had published on his YouTube channel. It said that these videos\ndemonstrated that the characterisation of the complainant’s views, and the\ndescription of his videos as set out in the articles, were justified.\nRelevant Code provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2* (Privacy)\n(i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\n(ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual’s private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosures of information.\nClause 3* (Harassment)\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\niii)  Editors must\nensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care\nnot to use non-compliant material from other sources.\nMediated outcome\n6. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n7. During IPSO’s investigation of the complaint, the\nnewspaper offered to publish the following statement from the complainant, on\nthe online article:\nI do not accept that my videos are\n\"hate-filled\".  I do not hate\nany group in society, and it is not in and of itself racist or hateful to put\none's own people first.  To hold an\nethno-nationalist or ethno-centric position is entirely legitimate and does not\nmake somebody \"vile\".  What I\nexpress in my videos are normal views that, I believe, are shared (whether\nopenly or not) by a large segment of the British public.  I would urge readers to look up my material\nonline - especially the forthcoming \"Statements\" series - and judge\nfor themselves.\n8. The complainant said this would resolve his complaint to\nhis satisfaction.\n9. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.Date compliant received: 14/01/2017Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 12/05/2017 \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
