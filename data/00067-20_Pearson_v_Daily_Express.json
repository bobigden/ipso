Terry Pearson complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that Daily Express breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “BRITAIN’S £26BN BREXIT\nTOURISM BOOM / Brexit tourism boom will benefit all of Britain”, published on 3\nJanuary 2020.2. The article, which began on the front page and continued\non page 4, reported on a forecast by Visit Britain. This forecast predicted\nthat in 2020 every part of Britain would benefit from increased levels of\ntourism. The article described the findings of the forecast, and listed various\ntourist sites in the UK. As well as the two headlines which referred to Brexit,\nthe first sentence, on the front page of the newspaper, reported that:\n“TOURISTS flocking to post-Brexit Britain will fire up the economy by\n£26.6billion”. The article also included a quote from the director of Visit\nBritain.3. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1 because Visit Britain’s report had not mentioned Brexit, nor\nhad the full statement of the director of Visit Britain, some of which was\nquoted in the article.4. The publication did not accept that the article was\ninaccurate. It said that the story, and how it was framed, was discussed with\nthe director of Visit Britain and she had no objections prior to its\npublication. After the article was published, both the director and Visit\nBritain had tweeted the article, which the publication said was evidence that\nthey did not find that the article inaccurately reported the result of the\nforecast. The publication also provided a statement from Visit Britain which\nstated that the article was factual and that the interpretation of the\ninformation, as well as the headline, was a matter of editorial discretion for\nthe newspaper.Relevant Code Provisions5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Findings of the Committee6. The Committee noted that whilst the headline of the\narticle had used the term “Brexit tourism boom” there was no suggestion within\nthe text of the article that the tourism boom would be caused by the UK leaving\nthe EU. Instead the article commented on projections for 2020, once the UK had\nleft the EU, and the income that would be generated after Brexit. On this\nbasis, the article was not misleading in the way that the complainant had\nsuggested. In addition, the publication had discussed the article with Visit\nBritain, the source of the data, prior to the article being published.  On this basis, there was no failure to take\ncare not to publish inaccurate information, and no breach of Clause 1.Conclusions7. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial Action Required8. N/AIndependent Complaints ReviewerThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review. Date complaint received: 04/01/2020Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 23/04/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
