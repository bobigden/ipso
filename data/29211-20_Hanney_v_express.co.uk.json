Jon Hanney complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that express.co.uk breached Clause 1 of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Car tax changes could force drivers to 'see\ntheir families less' due to heavy costs”, published on 21 November 2020.\n2. The article, which only appeared online, reported on\npotential changes to the current system of road vehicle taxation. It included comments\nmade by a named individual, who was identified as being the director of an\nelectric car firm, and was described within the article as an “expert.” He\nstated that, while it was “unclear” what the per mile charge would be, the cost\nof car tax changes “could be around 75p per mile which would see a 400-mile\ntrip costing over £500.” The article also contained a further quote from the\nexpert, stating that “[f]uel duty is charged at 57.95p a litre on petrol and\ndiesel vehicles.”\n3. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1. He first said that a 75 per mile charge would equate to a\n400-mile trip costing £300 , not £500 as stated by the article. He also said\nthat, by stating that the suggested charges “may be around the same as fuel\nduty for a similar mileage meaning a 75 pence per mile charge” readers may have\nbeen misled into believing that current fuel duty rates are around 75p per\nmile. The complainant noted that this was contradicted within the article\nitself, which stated that fuel duty is 57.95 pence per litre. He acknowledged\nthat the errors may have been the error of the quoted expert rather than the\npublication, but said that the publication should have taken steps to verify\nthe information, particularly as, on the face of it, the information was\nincorrect and contradictory. The complainant said that he wished for a\ncorrection to be printed, to put the correct position on record.\n4. The publication said it did not accept that Clause 1 had\nbeen breached by the article. It said that the expert quoted in the article had\nbeen quoted accurately, and provided a press release which it said the article\nwas based on; all disputed points of accuracy identified by the complainant\nwere taken, verbatim, from the press release. It also noted that none of the\nquoted experts were presented as fact, with the article making clear that such\ncharges “could sit around 75p per mile” and that it was “unclear” what the\ncharges may be.\n5. The publication also said that the article made clear\nthat fuel duty was 57.95 pence per litre, therefore readers would not be misled\ninto believing it was 75 pence per mile. It said that the latter figure was intended\nto be read within the context of the article as a whole, and the comparison to\nfuel duty rates was intended to highlight the similarity of the proposed charge\nto one drivers would already be aware of.\n6. The publication accepted that a 75 pence per mile charge\nwould not result in “a 400-mile trip costing £300.” It said that the figure\nprovided to the publication by the expert had been £533, and that this included\ncosts beyond a potential 75 pence per mile charge, including a 17 pence per mile\ncharge for electricity, and “additional charges coming from a proportion of the\nstandard fees that the government are said to be bringing in on top of this per\nmile charge.” It said that, since the article’s publication, another motoring\nexpert had said that potential new taxes could be anywhere between 2 pence and\n£1.50 per mile, and noted that the 75 pence figure was in the middle of these\ntwo estimates.\n7. While the publication did not accept that the Code had\nbeen breached, it offered to amend the article to make clear that the cost of a\n400-mile journey “could” result in a 400-mile trip costing “up to” £500, when\n“other fees” were included. The amendments would be accompanied by a\nclarification, which would read:\nClarification\nAn earlier version of this article did not make clear that\nthe £500 cost for a 400 mile round trip included other fees. We are happy to\nclarify this.\n8. The complainant said that, regardless of the fact that\nthe figures quoted in the article came from an “expert” it was the role of the\nnewspaper to fact-check information prior to publication to ensure the accuracy\nof its articles. He noted that the publication had not provided a basis for the\n75 pence per mile figure, nor explained what additional fees would lead to a\n400-mile trip costing an additional £200. \nHe said that electricity charges were not charges from the government,\nwhich was the focus of the article; as such he was confused why the publication\nhad said that these were included as part of their expert’s estimate. He also\nsaid, regardless of the article presenting the charges as possible charges\nrather than definite ones, the figures provided in the article were inaccurate.\n9. The complainant also said that the publication’s proposed\namendment would not address their concerns, as it did not make clear what\n“other fees” were included. He said that he would be willing to resolve his\ncomplaint should the publication set out exactly how it had reached the figures\nin the article.\n10. The publication amended its proposed clarification, and\noffered to instead print the following wording:\nIn respect of [the named expert]'s estimated calculation of\n£533 for the cost of a 400 mile round trip, we are happy to make clear that\nthis figure includes his predicted figure of 75p per mile, plus the cost of the\nelectricity at 17p per mile, and a proportion of the standard fees that the\ngovernment are said to bringing in on top of this per mile charge.  \n11. The complainant said that he was not willing to resolve\nhis complaint on this basis, as the proposed clarification did not make clear\nexactly what fees resulted in the £533 figure, nor did it his address his\nconcerns regarding the use of the 75 pence figure.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n12. The Committee was satisfied that the newspaper had\naccurately reported the original press release from the named “expert.” What\nwas in dispute was whether the publication had, prior to publication, taken\ncare over the accuracy of the information provided by him. It noted that the\narticle made clear that the points of accuracy under dispute were conjecture by\nthe businessman, and they were clearly presented as such by the use of\nquotation marks and by prefacing the conjecture with phrases such as “could\nbe.” Newspapers are entitled under the terms of Clause 1 (iv) to publish such\nconjecture. However, within the quoted individual’s conjecture were claims of\nfact – regarding the price of fuel duty and what cost a 400 mile trip would\nincur should each mile be charged at a rate of 75 pence per mile - and the\nnewspaper was required to take care over the accuracy of these claims under the\nterms of Clause 1 (i).\n13. The Committee noted that, while he was described as “an\nexpert” in the article, he was a business owner who was offering his opinion on\npotential vehicle tax charges. The individual’s position as a business owner\ndid not mean that the publication had no obligation to verify information\nprovided by him, where Clause 1 makes clear that the onus to take care over\ninformation included in articles lies with publications.\n14. It was not in dispute that the actual cost of fuel duty\nwas, at the time of publication, 57.95 pence per litre. The Committee noted\nthat the article included this figure. However, it also noted that the article\nsaid that the new charge could “be around the same as fuel duty for a similar\nmileage, meaning a 75 pence per mile.” This clearly implied that the current\nfuel duty stood at “around” 75p per mile. These two assessments of fuel duty\ndiffered significantly and it followed that one of the two statements was\ninaccurate. The publication did not take any steps to verify the contradictory\ninformation, nor go back to the commentator to clarify what he meant by his\nstatement that fuel duty was “around 75 pence per mile.” This resulted in the\npublication of inaccurate information. It had not taken care over the accuracy\nof this statement, and Clause 1 (i) was breached as a result, as the Committee\nconsidered that the statement could mislead readers into believing that the\nprice of fuel duty was around 75 pence per mile. In the context of a report\nabout changes to vehicle tax charges, the publication of contradictory\ninformation about current fuel duty charges represented a significant\ninaccuracy in need of correction under the terms of Clause 1 (ii).\n15. It was not in dispute that a “75p per mile [charge]”\nwould lead to a journey of 400 miles costing £300 and not £500, as reported by\nthe article. The Committee noted that the publication referred to other charges\nduring the investigation which may lead to a trip costing up to £500, however\nthe article itself did not make clear that the £500 figure included additional\nfees not referred to in the text, and that it included costs associated with\nrunning a car such as electricity. For this reason, the Committee found that\nthe article included misleading information, as it did not explain to readers\nhow the £500 figure had been reached. The newspaper had not taken care over the\npublication of this information: it could not demonstrate that it had taken\nsteps to clarify the exact nature of the charges. Clause 1 (i) was breached on\nthis point. The crux of the article under complaint was the potential impact\nchanges to vehicle taxes may have on drivers. By not making clear how figures\nrepresenting the impact of drivers had been reached, the article was rendered\nsignificantly misleading and in need of correction under the terms of Clause 1\n(ii).\n16. The publication had offered to amend the article and\nprint a clarification making clear that the £500 had been reached by including\n“[the named individual’s]  predicted\nfigure of 75p per mile, plus the cost of the electricity at 17p per mile, and a\nproportion of the standard fees that the government are said to bringing in on\ntop of this per mile charge.” However, the proposed clarification did not\naddress the inaccurate statement that fuel duty was “around 75 pence per mile”;\nas such, the proposed clarification did not address both breaches of Clause 1\n(i), and there was further breach of Clause 1 (ii).\nConclusions\n17. The complaint was upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n18. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1(i) and Clause 1(ii),\nthe Committee considered what remedial action should be required. In\ncircumstances where the Committee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it\ncan require the publication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms\nand placement of which is determined by IPSO\n19. The Committee considered that the publication had not\ntaken care when reporting on a press release, and this had led to the\npublication of inaccurate and misleading information. While the publication had\nproposed to amend and clarify the article, the proposed clarification did not\naddress each inaccuracy. As such, the Committee required that the wording of\nthe proposed clarification should be amended to address each identified\ninaccuracy. A correction was considered to be sufficient, as the publication\nhad already taken steps to put the correct position on the record and the\narticle had not adopted the spokesperson’s statements as claims of fact.\n20. The Committee then considered the placement of the\ncorrection. It should appear as a footnote to the original online article, and\nshould not only make clear that the £500 figure included other fees not\nspecified in the article, but the actual cost of fuel duty. It should state\nthat it has been published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation. The full wording and position should be agreed with\nIPSO in advance.\n \nDate complaint received: 22/11/2020\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 13/05/21\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
