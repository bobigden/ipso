Miqdaad\nVersi complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nthesun.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in\nan article headlined “SECRET I.S. SAFE Half of British Muslims would not go to\ncops if they knew someone with ISIS links”, published on 01 December 2016.\n2. The\narticle reported the findings of a Policy Exchange poll entitled “Unsettled\nBelonging: A survey of Britain’s Muslim communities”. The poll’s 3,000\nparticipants were asked: “If you thought someone close to you was getting\ninvolved with people who supported terrorism in Syria, what would you do?”. The\npoll found that 52% of British Muslims would report them to the police, 26%\nsaid they would talk to the person directly, 20% said they would ‘look for help\nfrom family and friends’, and 17% said they would seek help from ‘religious\ncommunity leaders’. The article reported that “almost half of British Muslims\nwouldn’t go to the police if someone they knew was involved with supported of\nterrorism in Syria”.\n3. The\ncomplainant expressed concern that the headline inaccurately reported the\nquestion asked to the participants in the poll. He said that there was a\nfundamental difference between the statement “someone close to you” in the\npoll’s question, and “if they knew someone”, which was reported in the article.\n4. The\ncomplainant referred to an earlier ComRes poll, Survey of Muslims in 2015,\nwhich found that 94% of respondents said that “If someone I knew from the\nMuslim community was planning an act of violence” they would report them to the\npolice.  The complainant said that whilst\nPolicy Exchange report and the 2015 Survey for ComRes were not based on the\nsame underlying data, this earlier poll provided context through which the\nfindings of the Policy Exchange poll could be understood. He said that when\ncompared to the findings of the 2015 poll, the Policy Exchange poll’s findings\ndemonstrated that more Muslims would report such an individual to the police\nand fewer would not get involved that the broader population.\n5. The\nnewspaper did not accept any breach of the Code. It said that the newspaper was\nentitled to report on the findings of the Policy Exchange poll only, and was\nnot required to introduce other polls into the article. It said that the Policy\nExchange Poll was a survey of British Muslims only, and it did not draw\ncomparisons between its findings, and the views of the broader population.\n6. It said\nthat the two phrases “someone close to you” and “if they knew someone” were not\ndistinct in their meaning, and one could be substituted with the other. It did,\nhowever, offer to amend the headline to “SECRET I.S. SAFE:  Nearly half of British Muslims would not go\nto cops if ‘someone close to them’ had ISIS links” as well as amend the first\nparagraph and replace ‘someone they knew’ to ‘someone close to them’. The\nnewspaper also offered to publish a footnote on the article, which stated:\nAn earlier version of this article reported that a Policy\nExchange poll entitled “Unsettled Belonging” found that half of British Muslims\nwould not go to cops if they knew someone with ISIS links. To clarify, the poll\nfound that 48% of British Muslims would not go to police, if they knew someone\nclose to them with ISIS links, 26% would rather talk to the person directly\nwith only 4% saying they would not get involved.\n7. It also\noffered to publish the following online clarification, to appear on the\nnewspaper’s homepage for 24 hours and thereafter in the Corrections section:\nA headline on a story “SECRET I.S. SAFE” (1st December 2017)\ncarried a sub-heading stating ‘Half of British Muslims would not go to cops if\nthey knew someone with ISIS link”. After listening to concerns from the British\nCouncil of Muslims, we have amended that to “Half of British Muslims would not\ngo to cops if someone close to them were getting involved with people who\nsupport terrorism in Syria”\n8. The\ncomplainant did not accept that the footnote and clarification proposed by the\nnewspaper adequately addressed his concerns. \nHe said that any correction must acknowledge his position, that when\ncompared to the findings of the 2015 poll, the Policy Exchange poll’s findings\ndemonstrated that more Muslims would report such an individual to the police\nand fewer would not get involved that the broader population.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n9. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information     \nor images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nFindings of the Committee\n10. The\nCommittee did not accept that the two phrases, “someone close to you” and “if\nthey knew someone”, were interchangeable. However, in circumstances where the\nfocus of the poll’s question related to whether or not an individual would\nco-operate with the police, it did not consider that the paraphrasing adopted\nby the article was significantly misleading. However, while the Committee did\nnot establish a breach of the Code, it welcomed the newspaper’s offer to amend\nthe article and publish a footnote and clarification.\n11. The\nselection of material for publication is a matter of editorial discretion.\nNewspapers have the editorial freedom to make such selections provided that\nthey do not raise breaches of the Editors’ Code. The newspaper were entitled to\nreport on the findings of the Policy Exchange poll only. The omission of an\nearlier poll, which was not based on the same underlying data as the Policy\nExchange poll, did not render the article significantly misleading, inaccurate,\nor distorted. There was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusions\n12. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n13. N/ADate complaint received: 15/12/2016Date decision issued: 20/04/2017 \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
