Duncan\nCassidy complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Jersey\nEvening Post breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 12 (Discrimination) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Vaccinations are not there\nto use when the horse has bolted. They create that bolt in the first place”,\npublished on 20 July 2021.\n2. The\narticle was a comment piece on vaccination uptake in Jersey. The article asked\nreaders to “think back to Christmas where a thousand cases in Jersey resulted\nin around 60 people in hospital. Roughly double that number of cases has\nresulted in around a dozen hospitalisations”. The article began by referring to\nthe case of “an unvaccinated man in his 40s with no underlying health\nconditions [who] died of coronavirus”. It also discussed the effects of\nvaccinations on coronavirus transmissions, stating that they reduced “the risk\nof transmission, but also reduc[ed] the number of unvaccinated people in the\nIsland among whom new strains can mutate”; “that EVERY mutation is currently\nsignificantly clamped down on by the vaccine”; and that “by strangling that\npetri dish of people, we’re reducing the chance of a new vaccine-evading strain\nemerging”. The article also reported that the risks of taking the vaccine “when\ncompared with crossing a road or taking a paracetamol – are equally miniscule”.\n3 The\ncomplainant said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. He said\nit was inaccurate to report that the previous Christmas “a thousand cases in\nJersey resulted in around 60 people in hospital”. The complainant provided a\nFreedom of Information response from the Government of Jersey which stated that\nbetween 1 February 2020 and 17 June 2021 there “were 40 admissions where\nclinical codes suggest either only acute care for COVID-19 was provided or the\ndirect symptoms resulting from COVID-19, or where it has not been possible to\nconclusively state whether another condition required during these admissions\nfrom coding alone”.\n4. The\ncomplainant said that the publication should not have published that the man\nhad died of coronavirus a few days after his death, and that this should have\nonly been published after an inquest which officially confirmed the cause of\ndeath had taken place. The complainant also said it was offensive to use the\nman’s death to promote the uptake of vaccines.\n5. The\ncomplainant also said it was inaccurate to report that vaccinating people was\n“reducing the risk of transmission, but also reducing the number of unvaccinated\npeople in the Island among whom new strains can mutate”; “that EVERY mutation\nis currently significantly clamped down on by the vaccine”; and that “by\nstrangling that petri dish of people, we’re reducing the chance of a new\nvaccine-evading strain emerging”. He said that there was no evidence to support\nthese claims as it gave the impression that coronavirus did not mutate in\nvaccinated people, and the prevalence of the Delta variant in vaccinated people\ndemonstrated that this was not correct, and that this variant had, therefore,\nnot been “significantly clamped down on”.\n6. The\ncomplainant also said it was a breach of Clause 1 to state that the risks of\ntaking the vaccine “when compared with crossing a road or taking a paracetamol\n– are equally miniscule”. He said that as of 2 August, the UK yellow card\nscheme had found there to be 1,512 deaths and 1,102,228 suspected adverse\nreactions after taking the vaccine, He said that the vaccine, therefore, could\nnot be compared to the risks of taking paracetamol or crossing the road. The\ncomplainant also said that the article was clearly biased towards one opinion,\nand that the publication should not be able to publish conjecture as it did not\nknow what the future would hold.\n7. The\ncomplainant also said that article breached Clause 12 as he believed it\ndiscriminated, ridiculed and segregated people who had chosen not to take the\ncoronavirus vaccine. He also considered the tern “anti-vaxxer” to be\ndiscriminatory in itself.\n8. The\npublication said, in its first round of correspondence, that it was not\ninaccurate to report that “a thousand cases in Jersey resulted in 60 cases in\nhospital” as it had received these figures from the government. It did,\nhowever, say that the figures could have been presented better as the figure of\n60 cases did not distinguish between those who tested positive for Covid whilst\nin hospital, and those who required acute treatment for Covid. It said that the\nfigures from the complainant’s Freedom of Information request were not\navailable at the time of publication, and that it was reasonable to rely on the\nCovid data reported by the local government which referred to 60 cases. It\nsaid, however, that the publication was entitled to compare the statistics\nroundly as they were like for like, and in the context of the article it was\nnot significantly misleading as the point being made was that substantially\nfewer people were found to have the virus in hospital after the vaccination\nprogram than before.\n9. The\npublication said that, whilst the inquest had not yet officially determined the\ncause of death of the man referred to in the article at the time of\npublication, it did not consider it to be inaccurate to report that he had died\nof Covid. It supplied a press release that had been issued by the government\nwhich was titled “Covid 19 death at Jersey General Hospital”, and stated that a\n“patient who had tested positive for COVID-19 has died at Jersey General\nHospital. The patient was an adult under 50 years of age and not classed as\nclinically vulnerable” and contained a quote from the Deputy Medical Officer of\nHealth who “emphasise[d] the importance of being vaccinated to be protected\nagainst COVID”. In addition, the newspaper said it had also been in contact\nwith a friend of the deceased who was aware he had contracted Covid and that he\nwas suffering severely with symptoms before his death. The newspaper said a\nnumber of other people close to the deceased also corroborated this and had\nstated that the man was unvaccinated. It noted that, after the publication of\nthe article, the man’s death certificate had been released and his cause of\ndeath was listed as Covid.\n10. The\npublication said that widely published scientific data made clear that it was\naccurate to report that vaccines reduced transmission and led to fewer\nmutations of the virus, and that at the time of publication the vaccines had\n“significantly clamped down on” every mutation. It said that as vaccinations\nreduce the rate of transmission, and as mutations are more likely with\nincreased transmission, it followed that vaccines reduced the risk of mutation.\n11. The\npublication, did, however, offer to publish a clarification on page 2 of the\nnewspaper:\nOn 2O\nJuly, the JEP published a column by Gary Burgess headlined ‘Vaccinations are\nnot there to use when the horse has bolted. They create that bolt in the first\nplace’. In it, he wrote: ‘Every extra jab adds to the community cloak of\nprotection. One by one, we’re collectively reducing the risk of transmission,\nbut also reducing the number of unvaccinated people in the Island among whom\nnew strains can mutate.’ The JEP is happy to clarify that, while vaccination\nreduces the risk of infection, and in doing so, helps reduce the risk of mutation,\nmutations can occur as a result of infection and transmission associated with\nboth vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Deputy medical of health Ivan Muscat\nexplained: ‘Mutations can only happen when the virus multiplies. If a mutation\nconfers an advantage that mutation will become more prevalent. Vaccination\nreduces infection and therefore reduces multiplication and mutation rates.\nThus, the more we vaccinate the less opportunity there will be for mutations to\narise which is one reason why mass vaccination is so important.’ Referring to\nthe second wave of Covid-19 over Christmas 2020, the article also stated: ‘A\nthousand cases in Jersey resulted in 60 cases in hospital.’ The article quoted\ngovernment statistics on the number of people who had been admitted to hospital\nand who also tested positive for Covid. A week after the article was published,\nthe response to a freedom of information request was published which stated\nthat between 1 February 2020 and 17 June 2021 40 people had been admitted to hospital\nbecause of Covid to receive treatment for its symptoms.\n12.\nAfter further questioning, which was delayed due to exceptional circumstances,\nwhich meant that it was no longer possible for the journalist to provide\ninformation to the newspaper regarding his sources for the article, the\nnewspaper was able to establish that the government had published inaccurate\ndata on its website. It provided an email from a named government source, which\nhad stated that the information relating to Covid hospitalisations had been\ndisplayed incorrectly on the government website; the correct position was that\n29 people were in hospital and 66 were in care homes, but the government had\ninverted these figures. Once the publication became aware of the error, it\namended its offered correction to state the following:\nOn 20\nJuly, the JEP published a column by Gary Burgess headlined ‘Vaccinations are\nnot there to use when the horse has bolted. They create that bolt in the first\nplace’. In it, he wrote: ‘Every extra jab adds to the community cloak of\nprotection. One by one, we’re collectively reducing the risk of transmission,\nbut also reducing the number of unvaccinated people in the Island among whom\nnew strains can mutate.’ The JEP is happy to clarify that, while vaccination\nreduces the risk of infection, and in doing so, helps reduce the risk of\nmutation, mutations can occur as a result of infection and transmission\nassociated with both vaccinated and unvaccinated people. Deputy medical of\nhealth Ivan Muscat explained: ‘Mutations can only happen when the virus\nmultiplies. If a mutation confers an advantage that mutation will become more\nprevalent. Vaccination reduces infection and therefore reduces multiplication\nand mutation rates. Thus, the more we vaccinate the less opportunity there will\nbe for mutations to arise which is one reason why mass vaccination is so\nimportant.’ Referring to the second wave of Covid-19 over Christmas 2020, the\narticle also stated: ‘A thousand cases in Jersey resulted in 60 cases in\nhospital.’ The article quoted government statistics available on the gov.je\nwebsite showing the number of people who had been admitted to hospital and who\nalso tested positive for Covid. It came to light after publication, and as a\nresult of the article, that this data on the government website was displaying\nincorrectly. The government has confirmed that the headings for hospital\noccupancy and care homes had been inadvertently switched and the table should\nhave read that there were 66 cases in care homes and 29 in hospital, and not\nthe other way around. The government corrected the mistake immediately after\nrealising the error on its site. A week after the article was published, the\nresponse to a freedom of information request was published which stated that\nbetween 1 February 2020 and 17 June 2021 40 people had been admitted to\nhospital because of Covid to receive treatment for its symptoms.\n13. The\npublication said that, in relation to the claim that the risks of taking the\ncoronavirus vaccine had comparable risks to crossing a road or taking\nparacetamol, the reporter was entitled to express this opinion based upon the\nwell documented data, including the Yellow Card Reporting referred to by the\ncomplainant. It said that, whilst there were known to be risks associated with\nvaccination, these risks were known to be small, as was the case with crossing\nthe road or taking paracetamol. The publication also noted that the newspaper\nwas entitled to be biased, and that the article was clearly marked as an\nopinion piece.\n14. The\npublication did not consider Clause 12 to be engaged.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause\n12 (Discrimination)\ni) The\npress must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual's race,\ncolour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or to any physical\nor mental illness or disability.\nii)\nDetails of an individual's race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual\norientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided unless\ngenuinely relevant to the story.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n15. The\narticle had reported that the previous Christmas “a thousand cases in Jersey\nresulted in around 60 people in hospital”. The information had been taken in\ngood faith from an official government website and appeared to reflect what the\ngovernment website has stated. The newspaper was entitled to rely on government\nstatistics as a source of information, and there was no failure to take care\nnot to publish inaccurate information under Clause 1(i). The Committee did not\nconsider it significantly inaccurate to report that Covid cases had “resulted\nin” people in hospital rather than reporting that they had been in hospital\n“with” the disease, where readers had long been familiar with the way Covid\nhospitalisations had been reported. After publication, however, the complainant\nprovided a freedom of information request that stated that between 1 February\n2020 and 17 June 2021, a longer period than “Christmas”, only 40 patients had\nbeen admitted for either acute care for Covid-19, its direct symptoms or where\nit was not possible to conclusively state this was not the only reason. After\nfurther investigation, it was established that the figures relied upon by the\npublication and published on the government website were inaccurate, and the\ntrue figure was under half of that reported. Where the article was drawing a\ncomparison between “around 60” cases and a dozen, and the correct position was\nbetween 29 cases and a dozen, the inaccuracy was significant and required\ncorrection under Clause 1(ii).\n16. The\npublication had offered a correction in its first substantive response to\nIPSO’s investigation. When further information came to light regarding the\nmistake on the government website, the publication amended the offered\ncorrection in line with this. The correction identified the original inaccuracy\nand put the correct position on record. This represented due promptness, and\npage 2 of the newspaper, where the article had originally been published on\npage 14, represented due prominence. Where the publication had offered a\ncorrection which put the correct position on record in its first substantive\nresponse, and amended I it as further information came to light, the Committee\nwas satisfied that the offer was made in a sufficiently prompt manner. There\nwas no breach of Clause 1(ii).\n17. In\nthe circumstances where the publication had been told by both a government\npress release a man had died of Covid, which had been repeated by multiple\nfriends of the deceased, it was not a failure to take care not to publish inaccurate\ninformation to report that he had died of Covid and was unvaccinated. Where the\ncause of death was later confirmed to be Covid on the man’s death certificate,\nthere was no inaccuracy to correct. The Committee also made clear that the\nEditors’ Code does not address issues of taste and offence. There was no breach\nof Clause 1 on this point.\n18. The\nCommittee noted that it was widely, albeit not universally, accepted that\nvaccines reduce the transmission of Covid-19, that lower levels of transmission\nreduce mutation rates, and that the vaccine leads to less severe cases of\nCovid. It therefore did not consider it inaccurate for the newspaper to report\nthis, nor to describe the vaccine as “clamp[ing] down” on “EVERY” strain. There\nwas no breach of Clause 1 on these points.\n19. The\ncomplainant also said it was inaccurate to compare the risks of taking the\nvaccine to those of crossing a road or taking a paracetamol. The Committee\nnoted that the comparison did not state that there were no risks to taking the\nvaccine, but that they were comparable to other everyday activities that had\nextremely low levels of risk attached. Where the vast majority of people who\ntake the Covid-19 vaccine suffer no long lasting or serious side-effects, the\nCommittee did not consider it misleading to compare this to the risk of taking\nparacetamol or crossing the road. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this\npoint.\n20. In\naddition, the complainant was concerned that the article was biased, and used\nconjecture. The Committee noted that the article was prominently labelled as an\nopinion piece and the Editors’ Code of Practice makes clear that the press has\na right to publish the views of individuals, to be partisan, to give its own\nopinion and to campaign, as long as it takes care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, and to distinguish between comment,\nconjecture and fact. The Committee considered that the article distinguished\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact, and therefore there was no breach of\nClause 1 on this point.\n21.\nFinally, Clause 12 is designed to protect specific individuals mentioned by the\npress from discrimination based on their race, colour, religion, gender\nidentity, sexual orientation or any physical or mental illness or disability.\nChoosing not to take the Covid-19 vaccine is not a characteristic protected by\nthe Code, and therefore there was no breach of Clause 12.\nConclusion(s)\n22. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n23. The\ncorrection which was offered clearly put the correct position on record, and\nwas offered promptly and with due prominence, and should now be published.\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 12/08/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 26/04/2022\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
