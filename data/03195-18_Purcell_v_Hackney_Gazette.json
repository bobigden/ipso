Dean Purcell\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Hackney\nGazette breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Hackney thug who assaulted girlfriend must tell police every\ntime he has new sexual partner”, published on 13 April 2018.\n2. The article\nreported that the complainant had been issued with a Criminal Behaviour Order,\nwhich ordered that for the next seven years he must, within three days of the\nthird time he has any sexual activity with a woman, give police her details so\nthey can speak to her. It said that in March 2018 the complainant had received\na custodial sentence after he had pleaded guilty to ABH and two counts of\nassault by beating against his former girlfriend. It also reported that\n“charges of false imprisonment, threats to kill, and a count of battery were\nleft to lie on file”.\n3. The article\nreported a series of events apparently leading up to the complainant’s\nconviction. The article reported that in November 2017 the complainant and his\nvictim had recently got back together after breaking up in July 2017. It said\nthat after they had moved in together the complainant had been attending\ndomestic violence meetings, but soon after he began to “assault her – by name\ncalling and slapping her”; it reported that “he then became extremely\ncontrolling”. The article said that on one occasion, the complainant and the\nvictim had an argument which resulted in him “pulling her hair and biting her\nright ear”. It said that later that day the complainant started “accusing her\nof having sex with other men and pounced on her, covering her mouth and nose\nwith his hands”.\n4. The article\nreported that the following day, the complainant again accused the victim of\nbeing unfaithful, and threatened to take an overdose; it said, “when she\nreassured him he then picked up a kitchen knife and said he would kill them\nboth unless she told the truth”. The article said that the victim felt unable\nto leave, because when she had asked to do so previously the complainant had\nthreatened to stab her and himself. The article said that “the victim felt\nunable to leave because of his behaviour and past experiences”; “when she had\nasked to leave before, Purcell had threatened to stab her and then himself and\nhad made the same threat whenever she wanted to call the police”.\n5. The complainant\nsaid that the article had created an inaccurate and misleading impression of\nthe conduct to which he had pleaded guilty. He said that the article had\npresented the allegations about his conduct which the victim had made against\nhim, as though they had been accepted by him as the basis for his guilty plea.\n6. The complainant\nsaid that the article had been based on an inaccurate police press release,\nwhich was subject to complaint. He said that this press release had presented\nthe allegations made about his conduct as having been established by the court\nas fact; he said that only the facts which he had accepted as part of his basis\nof plea, and which had been referred to in his plea hearing, should have been\nreported on.\n7. The complainant provided a copy of his Basis\nof Plea to IPSO. It recorded that the complainant had pleaded guilty to an ABH\ncharge on the basis of excessive self-defence: “The defendant felt it necessary\nto restrain the complainant. This involved holding her on the bed with his body\nweight and holding his hand over her mouth in an apparent attempt to prevent\nher making noise”.\n8. During the\ncourse of IPSO’s investigation, the complainant received the outcome of his\ncomplaint with the police’s press release. The police confirmed that its press\nrelease “contained information that had been alleged by the victim, but not\naccepted by the defendant as a basis for his plea of guilty. His plea was on\nthe basis of excessive self-defence which was accepted by the prosecution”. The\npolice invited publications to remove reference to incidents not included in\nthe Basis of Plea.\n9. The complainant\nalso provided a transcript of his plea hearing. This recorded that the two\ncounts of assault related to an incident where the victim’s hair was pulled,\nand one incident where victim had received “a punch to the leg while they were\nin [the complainant’s] car”.\n10. The newspaper did not accept that it had breached the\nCode. It said that it had accurately reported the details of the complainant’s\nconviction, as set out in the police’s original press release; it said that it\nhad no reason to doubt the accuracy of an official release from such a trusted\nsource.\n11. In light of the outcome of the police’s investigation\ninto the press release, and upon receipt of the information provided by the\ncomplainant during the course of IPSO’s investigation, the newspaper offered to\nremove the article as it appeared online, and replace it with a new version:\nA man who was jailed for assaulting a woman must now tell\npolice whenever he has a new sexual partner in a bid to protect potential\nvictims.\nDean Purcell, 36, was sentenced to 12 months jail for ABH\nand two counts of battery and on April 12, 2018, he was handed a Criminal\nBehaviour Order (CBO) applied for by the police.\nDuring the hearing at Wood Green Crown Court, Judge Noel\nLucas ordered that, for seven years Purcell must, within three days of the\nthird time he has any sexual activity with a woman, provide sufficient details\nto permit police to make immediate contact with the woman.\nThe order was only the fourth CBO issued in England and\nWales in a domestic violence case, the first and second of which were also\napplied for by Hackney police.\nA previous version of this article reported that Purcell had\ncalled the victim names, slapped her, became \"extremely controlling\"\nof her, and had bitten her right ear. We would like to make clear that these\nwere allegations made by the victim which were heard in court; these\nallegations were not accepted by Purcell as part of his guilty plea. Purcell\nfurther denied threatening to take an overdose and threatening to stab the\nwoman. We are sorry for the error and hope this clarifies the situation.\nIn fact, Purcell admitted ABH and two counts of common\nassault on the basis that he used excessive self defence. The conduct relating\nto those charges involved restraining the woman while holding her on a bed with\nhis body weight and holding his hand over her mouth in an apparent attempt to\nprevent her making noise, hair pulling and punching her leg while in his car.\n12. The newspaper also offered to publish the following\nwording in print:\nOn April 13, 2018, the Hackney Gazette published an article\nbased on a police press release about a court order relating to Dean Purcell,\nwho was jailed for 12 months for actual bodily harm and assault. Unfortunately,\nthe article suggested some of the evidence provided by the victim in the case\nhad been established by the court as fact. The claim that Purcell, 36, had\ncalled the woman names, slapped her, become \"extremely controlling\"\nof her, and bit her right ear, were allegations heard in court and they did not\nform part of the basis for his guilty plea. Purcell further denied threatening\nto take an overdose and threatening to stab the woman. We are sorry for the\nerror and hope this clarifies the situation.\nIn fact, Purcell admitted ABH and two counts of common\nassault on the basis that he used excessive self-defence. The conduct relating\nto those charges involved restraining the woman while holding her on a bed with\nhis body weight and holding his hand over her mouth in an apparent attempt to\nprevent her making noise, hair pulling and punching her leg while in his car.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n13. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported\nby the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n14. It was not a failure to take care over the accuracy of\nthe article to rely on the contents of a police press release which had been\nissued following the complainant’s conviction. The publication was entitled to\nrely on the accuracy of information from this official source. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1 (i).\n15. The article had accurately recorded what had been heard\nduring court proceedings; however it had failed to distinguish between the\nallegations which were accepted by the complainant as part of his guilty plea,\nand the allegations which were not. It reported, as fact, that the complainant\nhad name-called the victim; slapped her; bit her right ear, and threatened her\nwith a knife. These were not incidents which had been accepted by the complainant\nin his basis of plea. Accordingly, the article had given a significantly\nmisleading impression of the nature and extent of the conduct which had formed\nthe basis for his conviction. The newspaper had offered to amend the article\nsubstantially and append a statement at the end which made clear the correct\nposition. It was offered sufficiently promptly, upon receipt of the outcome of\nthe complainant’s complaint against the police press release and the court\ntranscript provided by the complainant. There was no breach of Clause 1 (ii).\nIn order to avoid a breach of Clause 1 (ii), the publication should take the\nremedial action it has offered in respect of the online article. As the article\nwas published online only, the Committee did not require the newspaper to\npublish a correction in print.\nConclusions\n16. The complaint was not upheld.\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer\nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
