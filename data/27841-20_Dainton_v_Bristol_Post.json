Hayley Dainton complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that Bristol Post breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2\n(Privacy) and Clause 6 (Children) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Wrong uniform Pupil sent home on first day back”, published\non 7 September 2020.2. The article reported on a mother who had criticised her\nson’s school for sending him home for wearing the wrong uniform. The mother was\nquoted in the article as saying “It is a real struggle for parents on a budget\nto be able to afford this expensive school uniform and shoes, and I’ve been\nsaving up as much as I could all summer. In the end, when I went to buy [the\nchild’s] uniform I found there’s a ten-day delivery time, and it didn’t come in\ntime.” The article named the mother, her son and the school, and contained a\nphotograph of the mother and her son in the outfit he had been sent home in.3. The article also appeared online in substantially the\nsame format with the headline “Mum's fury as boy sent home from secondary\nschool after 15 minutes because he wasn't wearing the right clothes”.4. The complainant, the woman quoted, said that the article\nwas inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. She considered that the article suggested\ninaccurately that she had financial difficulties and denied having said that\n“It is a real struggle for parents on a budget to be able to afford this\nexpensive school uniform and shoes, and I’ve been saving up as much as I could\nall summer.” She said that the point she had tried to make was that the shop\nhad not been open to the public during the summer, and that she had not\ndiscussed any financial matters with the reporter.5. The complainant also said that the article breached\nClause 2 (Privacy) and Clause 6 (Children) because it intruded into her son’s\nprivacy. She said that her son had asked the photographer to keep his face\nblurred in the photographs. Initially the complainant said that the\nphotographer had responded that he would ask his manager what could be done\nabout that, and later in IPSO’s investigation stated that the photographer had\nsaid his manager would “sort it out”. She said that her son was embarrassed to\nattend school as a result of the article, and that when he did attend, other children\nreferred to the article. The complainant said that this led to her son’s\npermanent exclusion and made her, and her son feel embarrassed and ashamed. The\ncomplainant said that the publication had not expressly asked for her consent\nfor her, her son, and the school to be named.6. The publication did not accept a breach of the Code. It\nsaid that the complainant had approached it about running a story on the issue,\nand it provided a copy of the email she had sent to its news desk. A reporter\nhad subsequently had a telephone conversation with the complainant, and\nprovided contemporaneous notes of this that reflected what had been written in\nthe article. The relevant passage of the notes stated that “Because of\ncoronavirus (they were) only doing online orders (and to) allow at least 10\ndays. I saved up all summer for this (but) they've got a massive backlog. I\nhave looked elsewhere;  ”I put it in 10\ndays on Tuesday I thought I could go in and buy it“... ”The teacher rang me\nlast week I told him the uniform hasn’t come. It’s a real struggle for parents\non a budget, I've been saving up as much as I could, it’s black trousers,\nschool shirt, (he) borrowed her tie, black sweatshirt.”7. The publication apologised that the publication of the\narticle had caused the complainant and her son distress, but did not accept\nthat there had been a breach of Clause 2 or Clause 6. It noted that the\ncomplainant had approached it about the story and had posed willingly with her\nson for photographs to illustrate it. It denied any knowledge that a request\nhad been made to pixelate the photograph. While the photographer no longer\nworked for the publication, it provided an account from the reporter. The\nreporter said that the photographer had discussed what the photos would look\nlike with the complainant and her son at the time they were taken, and that it\nhad received no instruction to blur the photographs from either the\nphotographer or the complainant. It said that the complainant had not asked for\nherself, her son, or the school to be anonymous. The publication did not accept\nthat the photographs contained any personal or private information about the\ncomplainant or her son and noted that all the information had been provided by\nthe complainant.8. At the start of IPSO’s investigation the publication\noffered to delete the online article as a gesture of goodwill.9. The complainant said that this would not resolve her\ncomplaint as she believed the harm had already been done by the publication of\nthe article.Relevant Code ProvisionsClause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading\nor distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the\ntext.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Clause 2 (Privacy)*i) Everyone is entitled to respect for their private and\nfamily life, home, physical and mental health, and correspondence, including\ndigital communications.ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.Clause 6 (Children)*i) All pupils should be free to complete their time at\nschool without unnecessary intrusion.ii) They must not be approached or photographed at school\nwithout permission of the school authorities.iii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or\nphotographed on issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a\ncustodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.iv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material\ninvolving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their\nchildren or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.v) Editors must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a\nparent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child's\nprivate life.Findings of the Committee10. Because of the apparent impact the story had on the complainant’s son, the Committee\nconsidered first the complaints under Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause 6\n(Children) about the publication of the unpixellated photograph.11. Clause 2 states that editors will be expected to justify\nintrusions into any individual’s private life without consent, and that in\nconsidering an individual’s reasonable expectation of privacy, the Committee\nmust take account of the person’s own public disclosures of information. Clause\n6 contains special protections for children. Clause 6(i) provides that all\npupils should be free to complete their time at school without unnecessary\nintrusion. Clause 6 (ii) states that children under 16 must not be interviewed\nor photographed on issues relating to their welfare unless a custodial parent\nor similarly responsible adult consents.12. At the heart of the complaint was a dispute that the\nCommittee could not reconcile: the complainant said that her son had requested that\nhis face be blurred, and that the photographer had responded that he would “ask\nhis manager”, and that later in the investigation said that the photographer\nhad said his manager would “sort it out”, but the newspaper then published the\nphotograph without further communication. The publication denied any knowledge\nof the request. It was not in dispute, however, that the complainant had\napproached the newspaper seeking publication of the story and had provided\ninformation about the dispute, including her own name, the name of her son and\nthe school. The complainant had volunteered this information for publication without any restriction on its use, and\ntherefore the Committee found she had consented to the publication of this\ninformation, even if she was not expressly asked for written consent.13. The complainant had also consented to the publication of\nphotographs of herself and her son by arranging and then posing for the\nphotographs. While it was a matter of significant regret that the complainant’s\nson’s education had been affected by the publication of the story, and that\nthere was a dispute over whether a request had been made for his face to be\nblurred; in circumstances where the complainant had consented to the\npublication of information about the dispute, including her name, her son’s\nname, and the name of his school, the complainant’s son would have been\nidentified even if his photograph had been blurred. On this basis, the article\ndid not breach Clause 2 or Clause 6. Nonetheless the Committee welcomed the\npublication’s offer to remove the article, given the distress caused to the\ncomplainant’s son.14. The Committee then considered the complaint under Clause\n1. There was a disagreement between the complainant and the publication as to\nwhether the complainant had said the quotes which had been attributed to her in\nthe article. The reporter had taken contemporaneous notes during the interview\nwith the complainant and supplied these to IPSO during its investigation.\nClause 1(i) requires that publications take care not to publish inaccuracies.\nOne way in which publications can demonstrate care taken over accuracy is\nthrough the production of contemporaneous notes. In this instance, the\npublication had been able to supply contemporaneous shorthand notes that\nsupported the accuracy of the quotes included in the article. Whilst the\ncomplainant denied that she had made these statements, where the\ncontemporaneous notes supported what had been reported in the article and no\ncounterevidence [MR1]  undermining the\nnotes or supporting the complainant’s position was presented to the Committee,\nthe Committee did not establish a failure to take care over the accuracy of the\narticle, and there was no breach of Clause 1.Conclusions15. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial Action Required16. N/ADate complaint received: 06/09/2020\nDate decision issued: 06/04/2021\n\n\n\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
