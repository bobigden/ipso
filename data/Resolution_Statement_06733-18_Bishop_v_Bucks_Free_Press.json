    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution\nStatement 06733-18 Bishop v Bucks Free Press\nSummary\nof Complaint 1.    Robert Bishop complained to the\nIndependent Press Standards Organisation that the Bucks Free Press breached\nClause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined\n“County council officials blasted for 'wasting taxpayers' money'”, published on\n31 August 2018. 2.    The article reported on the\ninstallation of council signs in High Wycombe which erroneously pointed to the\ntown’s “non-existent” Chair Making Museum. The article went on to include quotes\nfrom people upset with the purchase of the inaccurate signs, saying that\n“…there was never a chair making museum” and that “…there isn’t even a chair\nmaking museum.” 3.    The complainant is the proprietor\nof the Chair Making Museum in High Wycombe. He said that although the Council signs\ndid not point to the museum, there is still a Chair Making Museum in operation\nin the town; as such the article was inaccurate and misleading to report that that\nit was “non-existent” and to publish quotes to that effect. The complainant was\nvery concerned that this inaccuracy would have a significantly adverse effect\non his museum. 4.    The newspaper did not accept that\nthe article created the misleading impression suggested by the complainant. It said\nthat it was clear from the article’s context that it was referring to the fact\nthat the signs pointed to a Chair Making Museum which did not exist in that\nlocation. \nRelevant\nCode Provisions 5.   \nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not\nto publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including\nheadlines not supported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy,\nmisleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due\nprominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In cases involving\nIPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply\nto significant inaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to\neditorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture\nand fact.\nv) A publication must report\nfairly and accurately the outcome of an action for defamation to which it has\nbeen a party, unless an agreed settlement states otherwise, or an agreed\nstatement is published. \nMediated\nOutcome 6.    The complaint was not resolved\nthrough direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an\ninvestigation into the matter. 7.    During IPSO’s investigation, the newspaper\noffered to run a follow up article advertising the Chair Making Museum, and to\npublish the following clarification in their stand alone supplement advertising\nlocal businesses: “In\nAugust 2018, we published an article which referred to comments made about a\nsupposedly non-existent chair-making museum in High Wycombe. We would like to clarify that in June\n2016 Mr and Mrs Bishop following consultation with Wycombe District Council\ntook ownership and opened the High Wycombe Chair Making Museum at their\npremises ~ Kraft Village, Grafton Street, High Wycombe HP12 3AJ. We apologise if this caused any\nconfusion. 8.    The complainant said that this\nwould resolve the matter to his satisfaction. 9.    As the complaint was successfully\nmediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether\nthere had been any breach of the Code. Date\ncomplaint received: 12/10/2018 Date\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 06/11/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
