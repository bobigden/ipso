The article\nreported that Levi Bellfield had attended a party in the cell of another inmate\nat HMP Frankland in Durham.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that Mr Bellfield had not attended such a party, and that the article was\ninaccurate. In support of his position, he provided a statement from prison\nstaff, which said that there was no evidence to substantiate the article under\ncomplaint.\n4. The publication\nsaid that it had relied on a source for the story. It said that this source had\nprovided information in the past, and is considered to be reliable and\ncredible. The publication said that it had also contacted the Ministry of Justice,\nbut that it had denied the story, which is its usual response.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5.
