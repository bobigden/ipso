In fact,\nthe story concerned a woman who had an abortion, which had failed. The\ncomplainant considered that the headline had implied serious wrongdoing on\nbehalf of the medical profession, which had not taken place. \n3. The magazine did\nnot consider that the headline was an inaccurate summary of the contents of the\narticle. The subject of the article had an abortion under general anaesthetic;\nwhen she discovered that she was still pregnant, she had blamed doctors for\nleaving her pregnant against her will.\nRelevant Code provisions\n4. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for. \nMediated outcome\n5. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter. \n6. The magazine offered to make a donation to a\nmedical charity, and to publish the following correction in a forthcoming\nissue:\nCorrection\nIn issue 19, dated 12 May 2016, we printed a story with the\nstrap line: Unconscious when… Docs made me pregnant against my will\nThe title was intended to reflect the fact that the\ninterviewee had a failed abortion, and not that she was impregnated by any\nmember of the medical profession. We apologise for any confusion caused, and\nare very pleased to set the record straight.\n7. The complainant\nsaid that the magazine’s offer would resolve the matter to her satisfaction.\n8. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 16/05/2016Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 05/07/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
