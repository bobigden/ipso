The author said that he had no idea that 98 per cent of cyclists were\nwithout cover, and relayed a story told to him by a reader who was “out of\npocket” after an uninsured cyclist collided with his car. \n3. The print and\nonline versions of the article were identical.  \n4. The complainant said\nthat the 98% figure for cyclists without insurance was inaccurate. He said that\nof the estimated 5 million cyclists in the UK, 184,500 have third party\ninsurance through their membership of British Cycling, Cycling UK and the\nLondon Cycling Campaign, while there are other cyclists who are covered through\ntheir home insurance policy. He said that meant, at the very least, a minimum\nof 4% of cyclists had cover, and that the real figure was arguably higher. In\nany event, he said that no one really knows the true figure: it could be 6%,\n10% or 60%. \n5.The newspaper\nsaid that the 98% figure was taken from a blog posted by a reputable law firm.\nHowever, it accepted that there were no definitive government statistics on the\nsubject and felt that, in the circumstances, it would be appropriate to amend\nthe online article to state that “the vast majority” of cyclists were without\ninsurance, and to publish the following footnote:\nWhen this article was first published, Kelvin McKenzie used\nthe statistic 98% as the percentage of cyclists who do not carry proper\ninsurance. The statistic came from Pannone, part of the Slater and Gordon\nLawyers law firm, and in the absence of official government figures, he was\nentitled to rely on it. There are still no definitive figures on the subject so\nfor the sake of accuracy, we have deleted the percentage figure.\nIt also offered to publish a readers’ letter from the\ncomplainant on the topic.\n6. The complainant\nsaid that the blog had since been deleted; he said this was because the law\nfirm had said they had no confidence in the piece as they could find no support\nfor the 2% figure.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nFindings of the Committee\n8. There was no\ndispute between the parties that, at present, cyclists are not legally obliged\nto have insurance; neither did the complainant dispute that there were no\nofficial figures relating to this area. In circumstances where the 98 per cent\nfigure was used to support the author’s opinion that this law should be\nchanged, the Committee did not consider that an estimated figure taken from a\nblog on the website of a reputable law firm, in the absence of any official\nfigures on the subject, represented a failure to take care over the accuracy of\nthe article, or would have significantly misled readers on the issue at hand.\nThere was no breach of Clause 1. Nonetheless, the Committee welcomed the\nnewspaper’s decision to amend the online article, and publish a footnote. \nConclusions\n9. The complaint\nwas not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\nN/A\nDate\ncomplaint received: 15/04/2016Date\ndecision issued: 22/06/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
