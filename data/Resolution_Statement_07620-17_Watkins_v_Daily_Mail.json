Rob Watkins\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Daily Mail\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in relation to an\narticle headlined “Corbyn’s fantasy land”, published on 12 May 2017.\n2. The sub-headline\nof the article reported that the Labour Party manifesto launched before the\n2017 General Election would “cost every family £4,000”. The article stated that\nthe pledges made in the manifesto would cost £93 billion pounds a year to\nimplement, and reported that, based on the figures provided by the Labour\nparty, this would cost families an average of £4,000 each.\n3. The complainant said that the article had accurately reported that\nfigures released by the Labour Party suggested there would be, on average\n£4,000 per household of additional spending, but said the sub-headline\nmisleadingly suggested this was a fixed cost for every household would have to pay if the Labour Party won the election.\n4. The newspaper\ndid not accept that it had breached the Editors’ Code. The newspaper said this\nwas a customary way of presenting financial information, used to present\nfinancial information in a way that was readily accessible for readers. The\nnewspaper said that the sub-headline was to be read in conjunction with the\narticle, which made clear that the £4,000 was a household average. \nRelevant Code provisions\n5.    Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated outcome\n6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n7. Following IPSO’s\nintervention, the publication offered to publish the following correction in\nits clarifications and corrections column on page 2 and in the news page of\nMail Online for 24 hours before archiving it in the usual way:\nThe headline to an article on 12 May, based on a leaked\ndraft of the Labour party’s election manifesto, said that Labour's 'class war\nmanifesto would cost every family £4,000’. We are happy to clarify that, as the\narticle stated, the £4,000 was an average figure and did not represent an\nestimate of the amount Labour was planning to raise in taxes from each family. \n8. The complainant said that this resolved the\nmatter to his satisfaction.\n9. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 12/05/2017Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 01/09/2017   \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
