Daniel Borg\nOlivier complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the\nSunday Mail breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause 6\n(Children) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Malta\nlove-tug dad is arrested in cocaine bust”, published in print on 12 February\n2016, and \"Hope for Scots tug-of-love mum after cops bust Maltese dad and\nseize cocaine and guns\", published online on 12 February 2017.2. The article\nreported that the complainant had appeared in court having been arrested whilst\ndriving with his “friend”, following a “major drugs bust” and “guns seizure”.\nThe article also reported that the complainant, and the mother of his son, were\n“battling” in an international custody case regarding their son. The article\nincluded a picture of the complainant’s son.3. The complainant\nsaid that he was not a party to the police investigation which was reported,\nthat he did not face any drugs charges, and that his connection to the case was\npurely circumstantial. He said that this represented a failure to respect his\nprivate life. The complainant also said that his son’s name, age, and\nphotographs were used without his consent. He said that this represented a\nfailure to respect his son’s private life.4. The newspaper\ndid not accept that the photograph represented a failure to respect the\ncomplainant’s private life, as they did not feature him. The newspaper also\nsaid that the photographs did not reveal any private information about his son,\nand that they were published with the consent of the child’s mother.Relevant Code Provisions5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)(i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.(ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.(iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant\ninaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for.(iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign,\nmust distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.(v) A publication must report fairly and accurately the\noutcome of an action for defamation to which it has been a party, unless an\nagreed settlement states otherwise, or an agreed statement is published.Clause 2 (Privacy)i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.Clause 6 (Children)i) All pupils should be free to complete their time at\nschool without unnecessary intrusion.ii) They must not be approached or photographed at school\nwithout permission of the school authorities.iii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or\nphotographed on issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a\ncustodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.iv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material\ninvolving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their\nchildren or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.v) Editors must not use the fame, notoriety or position of a\nparent or guardian as sole justification for publishing details of a child's\nprivate life.Mediated outcome6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through correspondence between the parties. IPSO therefore\nbegan an investigation into the matter.7. In order to\nresolve the complaint the newspaper offered to remove the photos featuring the\ncomplainant’s son from the relevant articles, and to mark its picture library\nwith a warning not to use these images whilst the complainant has custody of\nthe child.8. The newspaper\nalso agreed to endeavour to contact the complainant for comment in relation to\nfuture articles about him, or where it would be relevant to do so.9. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to his satisfaction.10. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 12/02/2017Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 12/05/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
