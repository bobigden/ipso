Clare Warren complained to the\nIndependent Press Standards Organisation that mirror.co.uk breached Clause 1 of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined \"Who is Zoe Warren? How party girl became\nbrutal killer who posted 'moving' Facebook tribute to boyfriend after murdering\nhim\", published on 19 October 2017.\n2.\nThe article reported that the complainant’s daughter had been convicted of\nmurder and witness intimidation. It reported information about her background,\ncharacter, and details about the crimes that she had committed. The article\nalso included various comments made by a source who was allegedly a former\nfriend of the complainant’s daughter, namely that “when [the complainant’s\ndaughter] got into drugs [her parents] didn’t want her under their roof, so she\nwent to live with her Nana, but then her Nana kicked her out”.  \n3.\nThe complainant said that her daughter was not “kicked out” of the family home,\nor her grandmother’s home. She said that her daughter had spent some time away\nfrom the family home in 2013 and that she would occasionally visit her\ngrandmother overnight. The complainant also said that the article was biased as\nit only published comments which had been made by the source, and she expressed\nconcern that the source did not provide these comments in good faith.\n4.\nThe publication did not accept that there had been a breach of the Code. It said that it had interviewed a reliable source\nwho purported to be close to the complainant’s daughter; he had claimed to know\nthe complainant’s daughter well and was able to speak in detail about her\npersonality and background, based on his knowledge of her and her family. The\npublication said that it was reassured that the source had provided the\ninterview in good faith, because he demonstrated balance and stated that the\ncomplainant’s daughter’s actions seemed out of character, as reported in the\narticle. It said that in the circumstances, it did not have any reason to doubt\nthe veracity or accuracy of the information provided by him. The publication\nprovided a copy of the notes taken by its reporter during the interview, which\nrecorded the source’s comment that “[the complainant’s daughter] went to live\nwith her Nana then her Nana kicked her out”. \n5.\nNevertheless, the publication offered to remove the wording from the online\narticle and to add a footnote to the article to highlight the amendment made,\nas a gesture of goodwill.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni)\nThe Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii)\nA significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator.\nFindings of the Committee\n7.\nThe publication had interviewed a source who it said was able to provide\ndetailed information about the complainant’s daughter, including that she had\nleft her family home to live with her grandmother, and was later “kicked out”\nof her grandmother’s house. As the source was confidential, the Committee was\nnot in a position to comment on its reliability however, the publication was\nentitled to report the source’s comments. Furthermore, this information was\nclearly attributed to the source in the article, and there was no suggestion\nthat he had been misquoted. This demonstrated that the publication had taken\ncare not to publish inaccurate information. There was no breach of Clause 1\n(i).\n8. There may be circumstances where\nit is necessary for a publication to seek comment from the subject of the\narticle, where it intends to publish a source’s comments, to ensure the\naccuracy of the article. While the Committee acknowledged the complainant’s\nposition that her daughter was not “kicked out” of the family home or her\ngrandmother’s home, it did not consider that the inclusion of this information,\nin circumstances where the complainant’s daughter’s comment was not included,\nwas in breach of the Code: The article was a report of the complainant’s\ndaughter’s convictions of murder and witness intimidation, and it included\nvarious information about the complainant’s daughter, her background and her\ncharacter. The claim that she had been “kicked out” of the homes was a brief\nreference, clearly attributed to the source, and the comment was included in\nthe context of an article which focused on the contrast between the\ncomplainant’s daughter’s family life and criminal convictions. Furthermore, in\ncircumstances where the complainant accepts that her daughter spent some time\naway from the family home and would occasionally visit her grandmother\novernight, the Committee did not consider that the article was significantly\ninaccurate on this point, such as to require correction under the Code. There\nwas no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusions\n9.\nThe complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial action required\n10.\nN/A.Date complaint received: 25/10/2017Date decision issued: 18/01/2018\nReviewThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
