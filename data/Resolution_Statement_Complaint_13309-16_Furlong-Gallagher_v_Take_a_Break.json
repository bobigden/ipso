Molly\nFurlong-Gallagher complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\nthat Take a Break breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 4\n(Intrusion into grief or shock) and Clause 6 (Children) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “One last fairy-tale day”, published on 17\nNovember 2016.\n2. The article was\na man’s account of his marriage to the complainant’s mother.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that the article had contained a number of inaccuracies. She expressed\nparticular concern that it had inaccurately stated that she and her sister had\nbeen present when their mother had died, and that their mother’s ashes had been\nburied rather than scattered. She also expressed concern that the article had\nnamed her and her 16-year-old sister, and that a photograph of them had been\npublished without their knowledge or consent. She said the piece had caused\nthem considerable distress and had intruded into their grief.\n4. The magazine\nsaid that it was sorry that the complainant and her sister had been upset by\nthe article, which had been supplied by an agency; it was meant to be a loving\ntribute to their mother. It explained that the article had originally been\nwritten by their mother and she had provided the photographs. As their mother\nhad passed away before its publication, her husband had agreed to tell the\nstory on her behalf and he had said that his wife’s children, who were over 16,\nhad consented to the publication of the photographs. The words had been read\nback to him before publication and he had not raised any concerns about their\naccuracy. Although the magazine did not accept a breach of the Code, it said\nthat it would not revisit the story, and noted that it was not available\nonline.\nRelevant Code provisions\n5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported\nby the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nClause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings.\nClause 6 (Children)\ni) All pupils should be free to complete their time at\nschool without unnecessary intrusion.\nii) They must not be approached or photographed at school\nwithout permission of the school authorities.\niii) Children under 16 must not be interviewed or\nphotographed on issues involving their own or another child’s welfare unless a\ncustodial parent or similarly responsible adult consents.\niv) Children under 16 must not be paid for material\ninvolving their welfare, nor parents or guardians for material about their\nchildren or wards, unless it is clearly in the child's interest.\nMediated outcome\n6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n7. The magazine\noffered to make a contribution towards a holiday for the complainant and her\nsister. \n8. The complainant\nsaid that the magazine’s offer would resolve the matter to her satisfaction.\n9. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 16/11/2016Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 05/01/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
