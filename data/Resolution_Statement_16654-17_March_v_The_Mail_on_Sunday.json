Bridget March complained\nto the Independent Press Standards Organisation, that The Mail on Sunday\nbreached Clause 2 (Privacy) in an article headlined, “The terror law chief and\nthe ‘cover-up’ that could explode UK’s biggest bomb trial” published on 5 March\n2017.\n2. The article\nreported on concerns regarding the disclosure of evidence in a high profile\ncriminal trial. The complainant’s full name had been appeared on an image of a\n“restricted” document, which recorded her attendance at a case conference\nmeeting which took place before the trial.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that her profession was private information, therefore the publication of\nher full name in the article compromised her privacy and safety.\n4. The newspaper\nsaid that the document had been disclosed in public court proceedings and noted\nthat the article did not report the complainant’s profession. The newspaper\napologised for giving the complainant any cause for concern and removed her\nname from the image in the article.\nRelevant Code provisions\nClause 2 (Privacy) *\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health, and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual’s private life without consent.
