A woman\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Mail Online\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2 (Privacy) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Mercedes-driving Surrey woman with a ‘no riff\nraff’ sign on her door falsely claimed £110,000 in benefits by hiding her\nmarriage and splashed it on jewellery, a hot tub and other luxuries”, published\non 25 February 2017.\n2. The\narticle reported that the complainant had fraudulently claimed £110,000 in\nbenefits while leading a “lavish lifestyle”. It said that during a police raid\nof her house, the police had found a Porsche and a Mercedes-Benz, and other\nluxury items. The article was illustrated with images of the items found during\nthe raid, and a photograph of the complainant’s wedding.\n3. The\ncomplainant said that the publication had given an inaccurate impression of her\nlifestyle. She said that she had never owned a designer handbag; the items\npictured were either gifts or fakes; and the hot tub had been bought from ebay.\nShe said that the police had not found two luxury cars at her property: she\nowned a 12-year-old Porsche, and she had previously owned a 13-year-old\nMercedes. \n4. The\ncomplainant also objected to the publication of a photograph of her wedding.\nShe said she was married before she claimed benefits, and it was a basic\nwedding which she paid for herself.\n5. The\npublication said that the article was accurate. The published information had\nbeen provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), following the\ncomplainant’s conviction for fraud.  It\nhad been the belief of the DWP that they found an array of luxury goods at the\ncomplainant’s house, and photographs of these items had been presented to the\ncourt as evidence.\n6. As a\ngesture of goodwill, the publication offered to make various amendments to the\narticle, including the removal of the wedding photograph.\nRelevant Code provisions\n7. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\nFindings of the Committee\n8. The\ncomplaint was not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties.\nIPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter.\n9. The\npublication offered to remove the article from its website, and the complainant\nagreed that this would resolve the matter.\n10. As the\ncomplaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 07/03/2017Date complaint concluded: 13/06/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
