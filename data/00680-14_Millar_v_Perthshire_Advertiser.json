James Millar complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that an article published by the Perthshire Advertiser\non 19 August 2014 headlined “Granny cleared of stalking her family”, was\nmisleading in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice. \n2. The article under complaint was a court report of the\ncomplainant’s wife’s appearance in Perth Sheriff Court, where she had been\ncharged with engaging in a course of conduct which caused fear or alarm. She\nhad been cleared of all charges against her. \n3. The complainant said that the article had omitted his\nwife’s defence, despite including a detailed account of the charges against\nher. It had also omitted the sheriff’s view that the complainant’s wife’s\nevidence was to be preferred to that of her accuser. While it had been\nmentioned that his wife had been acquitted, the complainant was concerned that\nreaders would be misled by the one-sided nature of the reporting, and would not\nunderstand the reasons why she had been found not guilty. \n4. The newspaper said that the article was not inaccurate,\nand had clearly stated that she had been found not guilty. However, it\nacknowledged that the article had not sufficiently reflected the complainant’s\nwife’s perspective and explained that the freelance court reporter who had\nprovided the copy had attended the portions of the proceedings in which the\nprosecution presented its case and the pronouncement of the verdict. It offered\nto publish a follow-up piece with the complainant’s wife’s response to the\ncase, and an apology which read: \n“In our article concerning a case at Perth Sheriff Court\ninvolving Mrs Linda Millar, who was found not guilty of ‘stalking’ her son in\nlaw and his partner, we did not publish any part of her defence to the claims\nmade against her or any remarks by the Sheriff confirming that he accepted her\nevidence as being true. We offer Mrs Millar our apologies for not including\nthese matters.” \n5. The complainant rejected the proposed apology and asked\nthat the newspaper acknowledge that it had repeated “wild accusations” without\nqualification, and apologise to his wife for the distress caused and to its\nreadership for its poor journalism.Relevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \nFindings of the Committee\n7. The headline and text of the article stated that the\ncomplainant’s wife had been acquitted of the charges against her. The newspaper\nwas entitled to report on the charges against his wife, so long as it did so\naccurately and made clear that these represented allegations rather than\nestablished fact. \n8. It was plain that – as the newspaper had accepted – the\narticle had included limited information about the complainant’s wife’s defence\nto the charges. The Committee expressed serious concern about the way in which\nthe newspaper had reported the case. It did, however, welcome the newspaper’s\nprompt and positive response to the complaint, which included an acknowledgment\nthat the complainant had raised valid concerns, and subsequent offers to\npublish a follow-up piece and an apology. Nonetheless, in light of the fact\nthat there was no dispute about the accuracy of the material in the article,\nand the prominence with which the acquittal had been reported, the Committee\nconcluded that the article was not misleading; there was no breach of Clause 1. \nConclusions\n9. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received:29/09/2014 \nDate of decision: 03/02/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
