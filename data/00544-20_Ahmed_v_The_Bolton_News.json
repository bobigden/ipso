Abdul Ahmed complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that The Bolton News breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2\n(Privacy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Two years\nof ‘party house’ hell”, published on 29 January 2020. \n2. The article reported on a Saturday night party which had\noccurred in a property that had been rented out on Airbnb, which was stated to\nbe across “the road from the [named] pub”. The subheadline of the article\nreported that “Neighbours [had been] kept awake until 6am by teenagers using\nholiday home for parties”. The article contained several allegations from\nneighbours to the property who said that there had been parties at the\nproperty. One commented that “I have contacted the owner via Airbnb on numerous\noccasions to stop this happening but I have never had a response. There was\nonce a party on a Thursday night going on until 6.30am and the police were\ncalled. There have been around five or six parties in the last two months”. It\nalso reported that the party was “another addition to two years of problems\nwhile the house has been advertised on accommodation sites.” The article also\ncontained a quote from Airbnb that there had been “no previous reports of any\nissues with the property” and that it had “responded to a complaint made this\nweekend, made through the website’s Neighbour Support Tool, and removed the\nperson who booked the home from the service”. \n3. The article also appeared online and had been amended\nwhen the newspaper was alerted to the complaint, however, it was unable to\nprovide the original version. Nevertheless, the publication confirmed that the\noriginal online article was identical to the version published in print. \n4. The complainant, the owner of the property being rented\non Airbnb, said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 as,\nwhilst he accepted there had been a party on the Saturday night, there had not\nbeen any previous parties, nor had the police been called about them, nor had\nhe received any complaints from the neighbours through Airbnb. He said the fact\nthat Airbnb had stated that this was the first complaint about this property\nconfirmed this. He also said that it was inaccurate to describe the house as a\n“party house” as this gave the misleading impression it was being let as a\nhouse to party in, when in fact parties were not allowed at the property. The\ncomplainant said he had not been contacted prior to the publication in order to\ndeny the allegations. \n5. The complainant also said that the article intruded into\nhis private life in breach of Clause 2 because it included photographs of the\nproperty, one of which showed his car and its registration plate. He also said\nthat whilst his property could be found on Airbnb, its precise location was not\navailable until the person had booked it, whereas the article had stated it was\nacross “the road from the [named] pub”. \n6. The publication did not accept a breach of the Code. It\nsaid that the allegations that there had been several parties and that the\npolice had been called in the past had been based on a discussion with several\nneighbours and had been presented as claims in the article rather than asserted\nas fact. It did not consider that it was misleading to term the house a “party\nhouse” where the complainant accepted that a large house party had taken place\nthere on the Saturday night. The publication said it believed that the\ncomplainant had been contacted prior to the article being published, however it\ncould not confirm this as it no longer employed the reporter who had written\nthe story. Nevertheless, it did not dispute the account of the complainant that\nhe had not been contacted before publication. It said that, in any case, it had\nreceived a comment from Airbnb who had confirmed that there had been a party on\nthe Saturday night, though as the reporter had left the publication it could\nnot provide any details as to which allegations had been put to Airbnb. After receiving\na complaint directly from the complainant, the online article was amended to\ninclude that “[t]he owner of the property told The Bolton News that the terrace\nis not a party house and that he shut the party down at 10.30pm”. A follow-up\narticle centred on the complainant’s denials was also published. \n7. The publication said that the photograph of the property\nwas from a public listing on Airbnb and therefore there was no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy over it. It also said that the complainant had not been\nnamed in the article, nor had his personal address been used. \nRelevant Code Provisions \n8. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for. \niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \n9. Clause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. \nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so. \niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy. \nFindings of the Committee \n10. Clause 1 (i) requires that care is taken over the\naccuracy of published information; it does not include a standalone requirement\nfor publications to contact the subject of stories for comment. Nonetheless, in\nsome circumstances such an approach may be necessary in order for a publication\nto fulfil its obligation to take care. The publication in this instance had\ncontacted Airbnb for comment before publication; the question was whether it\nwas also obliged to contact the complainant directly. \n11. The Committee considered the nature of the claims and\nthe way in which they were presented. In this instance, the article had\nincluded comments and allegations from the complainant’s neighbours, which had\nbeen clearly attributed to them; throughout it was made clear that the claims\nwere allegations and not established fact. The majority of the disputed\nallegations centred on events at the house, at which the complainant was not\nsaid to be present, and not the complainant specifically. The substance of\nthese allegations was addressed in the comment by Airbnb, which was included in\nthe article. The only disputed reference to the complainant (who was not named)\nwas the claim by one source that the owner had not responded to previous\ncomplaints via Airbnb. \n12. Having considered the nature of the allegations, the\nmanner in which they were presented, and the inclusion of the comment by\nAirbnb, the Committee concluded that the publication’s decision not to contact\nthe complainant for his personal comment did not constitute a failure to take\ncare over the accuracy of the article. Nor was the article significantly\ninaccurate or misleading such that a correction was required under Clause 1\n(ii). \n13. The headline had stated that there had been “Two years\nof ‘party house’ hell”. Where the term “party house” was in quotation marks,\nthis was distinguishable as comment. Whilst the complainant disputed that there\nhad been problems for two years, it was not considered that “two years of hell”\nwas a statement of fact, and the article went on to make clear that the “two\nyears of hell” was the view of the neighbours. Where the basis was provided in\nthe article, the publication had taken care not to publish inaccurate material,\nand had distinguished between comment, conjecture and fact. There was no breach\nof Clause 1 on this point. \n14. The article contained photographs which showed the outside\nof the house and the complainant’s car, which could be seen from a public road.\nThe article did not report that the car belonged to the complainant, nor was\nthe registration plate included in the print version of legible in the online\nversion. In any case, these images did not disclose information about which the\ncomplainant had an expectation of privacy. In addition, whilst the address of\nthe property was not listed publicly, the rough location described in the\narticle as being opposite a named pub was also not something about which the\ncomplainant had a reasonable expectation of privacy. There was no breach of\nClause 2. \nConclusions \n15. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\n16. N/A \n \nDate complaint received: 29/01/2020 \nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 22/09/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
