Amitabh Kumar complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that The Sun had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 4\n(Harassment) and Clause 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock) of the Editors’ Code\nof Practice in an article headlined “Drunken bus doc ‘stroked’ girl of 15”,\npublished 18 August 2014.2. The newspaper reported that the complainant had been\nsentenced following his conviction for sexually assaulting a girl on a bus. The\narticle had been illustrated with a photograph of the complainant.3. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate\nand significantly misleading as it had given “undue prominence” to his status\nas a non-practicing doctor. He argued that the fact that he is a doctor was not\nrelevant to the case.4. The complainant said that he had been harassed by the\nphotographer who had taken his picture. He said that court staff had helped him\navoid the photographer as he had left the building. The photographer had,\nhowever, “stalked” him for around 150 yards. He had been followed by the\nphotographer and had been forced to run across a busy road.  He said that the photographer had followed\nhim for 300-400 yards in total. The fact that he sought help from court staff,\nand had been running away, clearly demonstrated that he did not wish to be\nphotographed.5. The complainant said that the conduct of the\nphotographer represented an intrusion into his grief and shock, in breach of\nClause 5. He said that the newspaper had been aware that he had wept while\nbeing sentenced, and yet a photographer still intruded into his grief by\npursuing him.6. The newspaper said that as the complainant’s\nprofession had been referenced in court. It also noted that the complainant\nsigned his complaint as “Dr Amitabh Kumar”.7. The newspaper said that the picture had been provided\nby another publication. The photographer had been sent to cover the case; he\nhad stood at least 150 yard from the court. The photograph had been taken on a\npublic highway, and did not represent a breach of the Code.8. The newspaper did not accept that the complaint raised\na breach of Clause 5.Relevant Code Provisions9. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published.Clause 4 (Harassment)i) Journalists must not engage in intimidation,\nharassment or persistent pursuit.ii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on their\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.Clause 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock)i) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries\nand approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication\nhandled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report legal proceedings,\nsuch as inquests.Findings of the Committee10. The complainant accepted that he was a qualified\ndoctor, and had not disputed that this had been mentioned during the court\nproceedings. The description of him as such was not inaccurate or significantly\nmisleading, and his concern about the prominence of the reference did not raise\na breach of the Code. There was no breach of Clause 1.11. The complainant and the newspaper had provided\nsomewhat contradictory accounts of the circumstances in which the complainant\nhad been photographed. It was apparent that the complainant had taken steps to\navoid having his picture taken, rather than making clear a request that the\nphotographer desist. Even on the complainant’s account, his concern that he had\nbeen followed by a single photographer, over what was apparently a relatively\nshort distance, did not constitute harassment or persistent pursuit, such as a\nraise breach of the Code. While the complainant had found the circumstances of\nhis conviction distressing, the Committee did not find that the photographer\nhad acted in an aggressive or intimidating fashion in seeking to obtain a\nphotograph. It also noted that there is a public interest in identifying those\nconvicted of crime. It did not establish a breach of Clause 4.12. The terms of Clause 5 relate to the obligations of\npublications when reporting on instances of personal grief or shock, and are\ndesigned to protect victims, and their families, from unwanted journalistic\nintrusion and insensitivity when they are at their most vulnerable. Coverage\nfollowing the complainant’s criminal conviction was not a circumstance which\nengaged the terms of Clause 5.Conclusions13. The complaint was not upheld.Remedial Action RequiredN/ADate complaint received: 14/12/2014\nDate decision issued: 24/03/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
