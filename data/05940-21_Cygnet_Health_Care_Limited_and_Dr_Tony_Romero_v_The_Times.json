Cygnet\nHealth Care Limited and Dr Tony Romero complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that The Times breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’\nCode of Practice in an article headlined “Doctor wins fight over heroin\n'cover-up'”, published on 4 May 2021.\n2. The\narticle reported on the findings of an employment tribunal, in which one of the\ncomplainants – Cygnet Health Care Limited – had been named as a respondent. The\nopening sentence of the article reported that “an employment tribunal has\nfound” that Cygnet had “attempted to cover up claims that heroin had been found\nin the room of a dead patient and sacked a doctor who told a coroner about\nit”.  \n3. The\narticle went on to report that Dr Romero, the then Managing Director of Cygnet,\ntold the doctor “that she should not mention the heroin at the inquest into the\npatient’s death” and “wrote to [the doctor], saying: ‘Are you telling me you\nwill go to the police?’ and ‘Do you know the implications of what you are\nsaying?’” In the next paragraph, the article stated that “[w]hen [the doctor]\nasked him what to say to the coroner, he advised her: ‘Do not make your life\ncomplicated.’” The article also reported that the doctor “was told by\n[Cygnet’s] solicitor not to mention the drugs” prior to her disclosure at the\ninquest.\n4. The\narticle also reported the sequence of events, namely that the doctor “was\nsuspended” from her workplace following the disclosures she had made at the\ninquest; that then “no action was taken and [the doctor] returned to work”; and\nthat she was later dismissed after she “decided to administer an antipsychotic\ndrug to an aggressive patient without [the patient’s] knowledge”.  The article reported that the “employment\ntribunal found that following her return to work [following her suspension],\nthe doctor was targeted by staff” in her workplace and “was later dismissed for\ngross misconduct over her care of a patient”. The article closed by reporting\nthat the judge had ruled against Cygnet, finding that it had breached the\ndoctor’s contract by dismissing her for gross misconduct “adding that senior\nmanagers had seized an opportunity to dismiss her”.  The article included a statement from a\nspokesperson for Cygnet confirming that it was appealing the decision and that\n“We reject any suggestion that there was an attempt to cover up the\ncircumstances surrounding the patient’s death.”\n5. The\narticle also appeared online in largely the same format, under the headline\n“Doctor wins fight over heroin ‘cover up’”. The article was accompanied by a\nphotograph of an arm and a discarded needle. The full article appeared behind a\npaywall, and only the first paragraph of the article appeared in full to users\nwho did not have paywall access, which included the opening sentence set out in\nparagraph 2 above.\n6. The\ncomplainants said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1, and\nthat there had been a failure to distinguish between comment and fact. They\nsaid, firstly, that the article inaccurately implied that the doctor had been\ndismissed because she had made disclosures to the coroner at an inquest into\nthe death of a patient. It said that\nthis misleading impression arose from the headline which was not supported by\nthe text of the article, and the opening sentence of the article which, having\nreferenced the alleged ‘cover up’, reported that “an employment tribunal had\nfound” that Cygnet “had sacked a doctor who told a coroner about it”. It said\nthat the photograph chosen to illustrate the online version of the article,\nfeaturing an arm and a discarded needle, supported the misleading impression\ngiven by the headline and the opening sentence to the article. They said that,\nrather, the doctor had been dismissed for gross misconduct following her\ndecision to administer drugs to a patient without his knowledge; as such,\nreferences to earlier events were, according to the complainants, “unrelated”\nto the dismissal. The true position, they said, was outlined in the tribunal\njudgment, which said that “[a]lthough the claimant was not dismissed for making\npublic interest disclosures, it was clear that senior management were not happy\nwith the situation and that her conduct in relation to the covert\nadministration of [medication] was used to establish a reason for dismissal“.\nTherefore, the complainants noted, the tribunal had found that the doctor’s\ninquest disclosures had not directly resulted in her dismissal. They said that\nthey accepted that a fuller description of the reasons behind the dismissal\nwere set out later in the article; however, this would not be visible to\nreaders who did not subscribe to the publication, as there was a paywall in\nplace preventing non-subscribers from reading this portion of the online\narticle.\n7. The\ncomplainants also said that, secondly, it was inaccurate for the article to\nreport that the doctor “was told […] not to mention the drugs at the inquest”.\nWhile the complainants accepted that the direct quotations from Dr Romero’s\nemails included in the article were accurate, they did not accept that the tribunal\nfound that Dr Romero had told the doctor that she should not mention the drugs\nat the inquest. They also said that it was inaccurate to report that the\nsolicitor retained by Cygnet to provide advice in relation to the inquest had\ntold the doctor “not to mention drugs at the inquest”. The complainants said\nthat they considered that the article’s claim that the doctor “was told […] not\nto mention the drugs at the inquest” was the publication’s opinion on the\nmeaning of Dr Romero’s and the firm’s solicitor’s interactions with the doctor,\nand that this was not distinguished from the findings of fact established by\nthe tribunal.\n8. The\ncomplainants also said that their position was that, regardless of the\ninclusion of a statement from Cygnet at the end of the article, the article was\ninaccurate and misleading and should, as such, be corrected promptly and with\ndue prominence, and any such correction should also include an apology.\n9. The\npublication said it did not accept that the article had breached the Code. It\nsaid that the article made clear that the doctor had been dismissed for gross\nmisconduct after she “administer[ed] an antipsychotic drug to an aggressive\npatient without [the patient’s] knowledge” and made clear the chronology of\nevents, and that the dismissal had occurred after “her return to work” from her\nsuspension following the inquest at which she had made disclosures. It noted\nthat the tribunal found that the doctor’s disclosures to the inquest formed the\n“general background” to the dislike of the doctor on the part of the senior\nmanagers, who had later “seized the opportunity to dismiss her”. As such, it\nsaid that the article made the chronology of the events leading to the doctor’s\ndismissal, and the reason given for the dismissal, clear.\n10. The\npublication again relied on the tribunal judgment, which it said supported the\narticle’s claims that Dr Romero ”told the doctor ‘that she should not mention\nthe heroin at the inquest into the patient’s death’” and that the doctor was\nalso told by the firm’s solicitor “not to mention the drugs”. It noted that the\njudgment referred to the email sent by Dr Romero to the doctor in which he told\nher “not make [her] life complicated” when she sought advice as to what to say\nto the coroner. The publication also noted that the complainants accepted that\nDr Romero had sent emails to the doctor in the terms set out in paragraph 3,\nabove.  With regard to the solicitor who\nwas advising Cygnet at the time, the publication noted that the judgment\nincluded references to the doctor’s conversation with the solicitor which it\nconsidered supported the article’s claim that he had “told [her…] not to\nmention drugs at the inquest”; in particular the judgment recorded, under the\nheading “The Facts”, that the solicitor had advised the doctor that “if she\nmentioned the discovery [of the drugs] it would affect [the doctor’s]\ncredibility and that she must have mis-remembered the event”.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n11. The\narticle under complaint was a news report – rather than a law report – of the\nfindings made in tribunal proceedings brought by the doctor named in the\narticle.  The tribunal had found that\nCygnet was in breach of contract for having dismissed the doctor for gross\nmisconduct, finding that the doctor’s decision to treat her patient, following\nconsultation with colleagues and the patient’s family, had followed the\napplicable guidelines.  The judgment,\nwhich ran to over 70 pages, recited the parties’ respective positions on a\nnumber of events, which included a disclosure made by the doctor at an inquest\ninto the death of a patient.  She had\ntold the coroner that she believed that drugs had been found in the patient’s\nroom, which the complainants disputed.\n12.\nClause 1 (i) of the Code requires that publications take care not to publish\nheadlines which are not supported by the text of the article. It does not\nrequire a headline to give the full context of the story in question, but the\narticle must support the headline; headlines should, therefore, be read in\nconjunction with the article as a whole. This consideration also applies in\ncases where only a portion of an article may be visible, as was the case in the\nonline version of the article under complaint, where a part of the article\nwhich gave the full explanation behind the doctor’s dismissal was not visible\nto those who were not signed into the website.\n13. The\nheadline to the articles reported “Doctor wins fight over heroin ‘cover-up’”\nand the opening sentence of the article, which was visible to all readers,\nstated that: “One of Britain’s largest providers of mental health services\nattempted to cover up claims that heroin had been found in the room of a dead\npatient and sacked a doctor who told a coroner about it, an employment tribunal\nhas found”. Both the headline and the opening sentence of the article,\ntherefore, linked the disclosures made by the doctor at the inquest with her\ndismissal, but neither reported that she had been dismissed for making the\ndisclosures. Reporting on a link between the disclosures and the dismissal did\nnot render the headline or the article misleading or inaccurate, where a link\nwas made in the tribunal judgment; the tribunal had found that “[a]lthough the\nclaimant was not dismissed for making public interest disclosures, it was clear\nthat senior management were not happy with the situation and that her conduct\nin relation to the covert administration of [medication] was used to establish\na reason for dismissal.  The disclosures\nacted as a backdrop”.  Neither the\nheadline nor the opening sentence of the article was misleading or inaccurate\nas to the reason for the doctor’s dismissal, even when read in isolation. The\nCommittee was further satisfied that the article made clear that the doctor was\n“later dismissed for gross misconduct over her care for a patient”.  There was no breach of Clause 1 in respect of\nthe report of the reasons for the doctor’s dismissal.\n14. It\nwas not in dispute that, after the doctor had indicated an intention to give\nevidence to the inquest of her belief that drugs had been found in the\npatient’s room, Dr Romero had sent an email to her saying “Do not make your\nlife complicated” and that he had also sent emails to her about the issue in\nthe following terms: “Are you telling me you will go to the police?”, “Do you\nknow the implications of what you are saying?”. These emails were accurately\nreproduced in the article and were characterised by the publication as Dr\nRomero having told the doctor that she should not mention the heroin at the\ninquest into the patient’s death. The Committee noted that the judgment\nindicated that it was the view of the solicitor who was advising Cygnet in\nrelation to the inquest that the doctor’s claim regarding the discovery of\ndrugs in the patient’s room was not relevant to the patient’s death.  However, it was not in dispute that the\ntribunal judgment had recorded, under the heading “The Facts”, that the\nsolicitor had advised the doctor that “if she mentioned the discovery [of the\ndrugs] it would affect [the doctor’s] credibility and that she must have\nmis-remembered the event”, which the publication had characterised as him\ntelling the doctor not to mention the drugs. The Committee noted that the\narticle clearly identified the findings which had been made by the tribunal,\nand that the characterisations as to what the doctor had been told by Dr Romero\nand the solicitor were not reported as findings. Taking into account the nature\nof the emails sent to the doctor by Dr Romero and the passages in the tribunal\njudgment, above, the Committee did not consider that, in all the circumstances,\nthe publication’s characterisations were inaccurate or misleading in breach of\nthe Code. There was no breach of Clause 1.\n15. The\nCommittee understood that the complainants had expressed concern about the use\nof a picture published in the online version of the article which appeared to\ndepict drug use. The Committee did not consider that the picture rendered the\narticle inaccurate, misleading, or distorted, where the article made clear that\nthe tribunal proceedings on which the article reported had heard that evidence\nhad been given to an inquest about alleged drug use by the deceased patient.\nThere was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\nConclusions\n16. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n17. N/A\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 03/06/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO:  16/11/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
