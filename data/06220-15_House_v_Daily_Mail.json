It reported that police and fire\ncrews had launched an investigation into the explosion, and that the\ncomplainant’s father, who had owned the property for 53 years, had said that\nthe building would have to be “flattened”. The article was accompanied by a\nnumber of photographs taken from outside the property, showing the extent of\nthe damage. Some of the photographs showed the interior of the house, which had\nbeen made visible by the absence of an external wall.  Some furniture and other items were visible\nincluding bed clothes, the rear of a book case, a desktop computer, a picture\nhanging on a wall, a bath, a shower and a toilet. The article was also\naccompanied by a video taken from the same vantage points as the photographs,\nand showing the same information.\n3.\nThe complainant said that the photographs were taken on her land at the rear of\nthe house, and that no one had approached her about taking them. She said that\nher bedroom, bathroom and stairs were clearly visible in the photographs, and\nthat this aspect of the property had not been visible to members of the\npublic.  She said that the contents of\nher home are private, and that the photographs were intrusive. She noted that a\nmember of public had commented on the fact that she had no cover on her duvet,\nand that jokes had been made about her bath, which was shown hanging off the\nside of the building. She said that her house was looted, which the police\nwarned her would happen after the pictures were published. The complainant said\nthat she did not object to the incident being reported on, or the use of\nphotographs taken from the nearby public road.\n4.\nThe newspaper said that the pictures illustrated the damage caused by a gas\nexplosion, and did not show anything of an intrinsically private nature. It\nsaid that while it was not possible to take a photograph of a house that has\nlost its external walls without some of the interior being visible, the force\nof the explosion had made the rooms unrecognisable. The newspaper said that\nthere was a public interest in publishing such photographs, because they serve\nas a warning about the care that needs to be taken with gas appliances.\n5.\nThe newspaper said that the agency photographer had originally taken some\nphotographs from the road, but did not have a good view of the most damaged\npart of the house. After asking around in the area, the photographer spoke to a\nman who identified himself as the complainant’s father, and the owner of the\nproperty. He asked where he could a take a picture of the damage to the house,\nand he was directed to a spot at the rear of the property, which was where the\nphotographs were taken. The newspaper said that this spot was accessed without\ncrossing any barriers or cordons, or opening any gates.\n6.\nThe complainant said that her father was unable to recall his conversations\nwith the press, but that he was sure that he did not escort, indicate or show\nanybody to a position where they could take the photographs. The complainant\nsaid that the fire brigade had cordoned off the land on which the photographs\nwere taken with tape. She said that while the newspaper had argued that the\npublication of the photographs was in the public interest, it had not been\ninterested in what had caused the explosion, nor did she believe the public\nwould be better informed about the importance of gas safety as a result of the\nreporting.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\n7.\nClause 3 (Privacy)\ni)\nEveryone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home,\nhealth and correspondence, including digital communications.ii)\nEditors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private\nlife without consent. Account will be taken of the complainant's own public\ndisclosures of information.\nThe Public Interest\n1. The public interest includes, but is not\nconfined to:\nii) Protecting public health and safety\nFindings\nof the Committee\n8.\nThe Committee recognised the difficulty and distress the gas explosion caused\nthe complainant. It appreciated that the publication of this footage may have\ncaused the complainant additional distress at what was a difficult time.\n9.\nHowever, given the extent of the damage, including the destruction of external\nwalls, the visibility of some of the damage from a public road, the presence of\nemergency services and the fact that the explosion was a significant and\nlegitimate news story, the complainant did not have a reasonable expectation\nthat her property was a private place. The furniture and other items depicted\nin the photograph and video were common household items which did not reveal\nany particular details about the complainant’s private life. Further, the\nphotograph and video only showed what could be seen by standing at the rear of\nthe property; the photographer did not enter the building. In addition, there\nwas a public interest in illustrating the extent of the damage caused by the\ngas explosion, which highlighted the importance of gas safety. Because of the\nextent of the damage, it would not have been possible to do so without showing\nsome of what had previously been the internal contents of the house.\n10. On the newspaper’s account, the\ncomplainant’s father identified himself, and explained where the photographer\nshould stand to get the best picture. The complainant denied that her father\nescorted the photographer to this spot or indicated where to go, but said that\nher father could not recollect what he had said in his conversations to the\npress. In these circumstances, the Committee accepted the account of the\nconversation provided by the newspaper.\n11.\nThis gas explosion was the legitimate subject of news coverage, and\nillustrating the extent of the damage was in the public interest. There was no\nfailure to respect the complainant’s privacy, and there was no breach of Clause\n3.\nConclusions\n12.\nThe complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\nN/A\nDate\ncomplaint received: 15/12/2015Date\ndecision issued: 02/03/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
