Nicola\nGomersall complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation on behalf\nof herself and her husband, Kevin Gomersall, that mirror.co.uk breached Clause\n1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Couple\n'have to feed their 5 kids nothing but ready meals' due to 'nightmare' crisis”,\npublished on 1 July 2022.\n2. The\narticle was based on an interview with complainant and her husband, with\nanother publication, in which they discussed the rising cost of living. The\nsub-heading reported that the couple had said “they can only afford to feed\ntheir kids cheap ready meals, can't afford to go out and spend £50 a week in\nfuel to take one child to school”. It went on to report that the couple had\nbeen selling items at a car boot sale to get more money, with the complainant\nquoted as saying: “With all the prices going up, it’s going to become a choice\nof eating or taking your kids to school.” It reported that the couple said that\n“rising costs have made their lives miserable”. It quoted the complainant\nsaying, “Our kids don’t eat as healthy anymore because it costs too much for\nfood. We’re giving them ready meals, something quick and simple”. It also\nreported that the complainant said that the rising fuel costs meant it cost £50\na week to take their 15-year-old child to school: “Our son goes to Tadcaster\nGrammar. I’m having to there and back every day – it costs me about £50 a week\nnow to get my kid to school”. It then reported that this child was on the\nwaiting list for the school bus, which cost around £80 a month. It also\nreported that rising energy cost had also “taken a toll on the couple’s\nfinances” as their children used  “their\nvarious computers or games consoles throughout the day as they’re off school”,\nwith the complainant’s husband adding: “It’s a bit of a nightmare. We don’t\neven get to go out anymore. We basically have to sit in because we have no more\nmoney to pay”.\n3. The\narticle was accompanied by three photographs of the couple at a car boot sale,\ncaptioned, respectively: “Parents Kevin and Nicola Gomersall say they have been\nstruggling with the cost of living crisis”; “The couple say that rising fuel\ncosts mean they spend £50 a week taking one child to school”; “The couple say\nthey have been selling items at car boot sales to get more money”.\n4. The\narticle was also promoted on the publication’s Facebook page under the headline\n“Couple ‘feeding their 5 kids nothing but ready meals’ due to ‘nightmare’\ncrisis”. It was shared with an image of the complainant and her husband and\nalongside a status which read: “With all the prices going up, it’s going to\nbecome a choice of eating or taking your kids to school”. \n5. The\ncomplainant said the article and Facebook post misrepresented the comments she\nand her husband had made to the journalist. The complainant said that they did\nnot tell the reporter that their family were “struggling” and “miserable”;\ncould “only afford to feed their kids cheap ready meals”; and needed to sell\noff their possessions. She said that the article inaccurately and misleadingly\nreported that her children played their various “computer and games consoles”\nthroughout the day “as they’re off school”. While she accepted that her\nchildren played with these devices in their spare time, they each attended\nschool; they were not out of school and playing on these consoles as the\narticle suggested. She also said the article was inaccurate to report that her\n15-year-old son attended “Tadcaster Grammar” and was on the “waiting list for\nthe school bus”. While the complainant accepted that another one of her\nchildren attended this school and was waiting for a place on the school bus,\nher 15-year-old son attended a separate school, Wetherby School, and already\nhad a place on the school bus.\n6. The\npublication did not accept a breach of the Editors’ Code. The publication said\nthat the article was an accurate report of the interview by the complainant and\nher husband with its sister publication, and provided an audio recording of the\ninterview to IPSO to demonstrate this as well as the reporter’s notes. It added\nthat the complainant and her husband had consented to the interview with its\nsister publication, with the reporter identifying which publication they\nrepresented and the purpose of the interview: to discuss the cost-of-living\ncrisis its impact on families with sellers at the car boot sale.\n7. The\npublication said both the audio recording and reporter’s notes showed that the\ncomplainant had discussed the increasing costs and difficulties faced by their\nfamily, with the complainant’s husband saying that the extra money made from\nthe car boot sales did “help”. In the recording, the complainant’s husband said\nit was “tough” with “everything going up” including “food”, “petrol, gas [and]\nelectric”. The reporter asked whether the complainant and her husband were\n“feeling the strain” of feeding a family with five children to which the\ncomplainant’s husband agreed. The reporter then asked what “sort of changes”\nthe pair had had to make as a consequence of rising cost, with the\ncomplainant’s husband saying that the “kids [do] not eat as healthy anymore as\nit costs too much […] so we are giving them ready meals”. In the recording, the\ncomplainant’s husband also said “[i]t’s a nightmare […] we don’t even get to go\nout anymore […] we are basically sat in because we have no money at all and\nmade reference to “arguments”: “When you’re living with each other, it causes a\nlot of arguments. You get angry. You need your space.” \n8. The\npublication did not accept that the article was inaccurate or misleading to\nreport that the complainant‘s children were “on their various computers or\ngames consoles throughout the day as they’re off school”. In the recording, the\ncomplainant and her husband also made reference to “game consoles” and the cost\nof electricity: “In our house, we have all the computers going […] when the\nkids are off school […] our electric is through the roof”. Further, the\npublication said it was clear that the children were currently on their summer\nholidays.\n9. In\naddition, the publication accepted that complainant had been referring to a\ndifferent child in her interview; her “15-year-old” child did not attend\n“Tadcaster Grammar”. While the publication did not accept that this amounted to\na significant inaccuracy, it offered to amend the online article and to publish\nthe following footnote correction:\n“A\nprevious version of this article reported that the child that attended\nTadcaster Grammar School was 15. In fact, this child is 13 years old. We are\nhappy to clarify this”\n10. The\ncomplainant did not consider that the amendments to the online article and\nfootnote correction were adequate. The complainant expressed concern that the\nwording did not address her primary concerns that the article had\nmisrepresented her and her husband’s comments and did not include an apology\nfor the inaccuracies.\n11. In\nresponse to the audio recording provided by the publication, the complainant\nsaid that it had been edited. For example, it omitted her response when her\nhusband told the reporter that he gave their children ready meals: “I have never\ngiven them ready meals, you cheeky sod”.\n12. The\npublication denied that the audio recording had been interfered with or altered\nin any way.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n13. The\nCommittee was clear that a newspaper’s obligations under the Editors’ Code\nextends to all editorial content it publishes, including material obtained from\nsister publications, and that care should be taken to ensure that information\nis not inaccurate, misleading, or distorted.\n14. In\nconsidering the accuracy of the article, the Committee had regard for the\nreporter’s notes and the audio recording provided by the publication. The\nCommittee noted the complainant’s position that the audio recording had been\nedited to remove something that she had said. However, in the absence of any\nspecific evidence in support of this position, and there was not, to the\nregular listener, any suggestion in the recording that it had been edited, the\nCommittee proceeded on the grounds that the audio file was an unedited\nrecording of the complainant’s conversation with the reporter. The Committee\nthen turned to consider whether the article had accurately reported the\ncomments made by the complainant and her husband in that recording.\n15. The\nheadline of the article, and the accompanying Facebook post, reported that the\ncouple were feeding their “5 kids nothing but ready meals”. However, the audio\nrecording of the interview did not support this assertion. While the\ncomplainant and her husband had indicated that due to higher food prices, they\nhad changed their family’s eating habits and were now feeding their children\nready meals; they did not, in any way, suggest that they were feeding their\nchildren “nothing but” ready meals. The headline claim did not reflect the\ncomplainant’s comments and consequently gave the clear and misleading\nimpression that their children’s diet consisted solely of this particular\ncategory of food. On this basis, the publication had failed to take care not to\npublish inaccurate and misleading information in breach of Clause 1(i).\n16. In\nthe particular context of an interview with two parents where the claim related\nto the quality of food that they were giving their children this inaccuracy was\nconsidered significant by the Committee: it distorted the complainant’s\ncomments during the interview and suggested that the couple had been forced to\nfeed their children “nothing but” ready meals, which they had not. It therefore\nrequired correction under Clause 1 (ii). No correction had been offered by the\npublication. There was therefore a breach of Clause 1 (ii).\n17. The\nCommittee then considered whether the article was inaccurate to report that the\ncomplainant’s children were on “various computer or games consoles throughout\nthe day as they’re off school”.  In the\nrecording, the complainant’s husband told the reporter “when the kids are off\nschool” they have “all the computers going” and as a consequence of this the\n“electric [was] through the roof”. However, the article had misreported the\nquotation; substituting “as” for “when” and in so doing wrongly suggested that\nthe complainant’s children were not in school when they otherwise should be and\nplaying on computer or games consoles during that time. This statement was not\nsupported by the audio recording or the reporter’s notes. On this basis, the\npublication had not taken sufficient care over the accuracy of the\ncomplainant’s comments in breach of Clause 1 (i).\n18. In\nthe view of the Committee, the suggestion that the complainant’s children were\nnot at school when they should be was significant and required correction under\nClause 1 (ii). As no correction had been offered, this represented a further\nbreach of Clause 1(ii).\n19. The\nCommittee next considered the complainant’s concerns that the article reported\nthat her and her husband were “struggling”; had been “selling their\npossessions”; and that increased costs had made their lives a “misery”. The\nCommittee noted that the interview had been conducted at a car boot sale where\nthe complainant was selling items. In addition, the Committee noted that,\nduring the interview, the complainant’s husband said that the extra money made\nfrom the sales did “help” with rising costs. Further, the Committee noted the\ncomplainant and her husband had stated during the interview that increasing costs\nwere making life “tough” and “a nightmare”; actively agreed that their family\nwere feeling the “strain”; and referred to “arguments”. In this context, the\nCommittee was satisfied that the comments made by the couple, and relied upon\nby the publication, provided a sufficient basis for the manner in which the\npublication had summarised and characterised the complainant’s position; it was\nnot a failure to take care over the accuracy of the article to report that the\ncouple were “struggling”; had been “selling their possessions”; and their lives\nwere a “misery”. Further, the Committee did not consider that the publication’s\nsummary of the comments made by the complainant and her husband were\nsignificantly inaccurate or misleading. There was no breach of Clause 1 on\nthese points.\n20.\nFinally, the Committee did not consider reporting that the complainant’s\n“15-year-old” child attended Tadcaster Grammar School rendered the article\ninaccurate or misleading. The section of the article where this statement appeared\nhad focused on the practicalities and costs of transporting one of the\ncomplainant’s children to school. Taken in this context, and where it was not\nin dispute that another of the complainant’s children attended this particular\nschool and was waiting for a place on the school bus, the misreporting of the\nage of the child did not constitute a failure to take care or represent a\nsignificant inaccuracy requiring correction under Clause 1. Notwithstanding\nthis, the Committee welcomed the publication’s offer to publish a footnote\ncorrection addressing this point.   \nConclusion(s)\n21. The\ncomplaint was upheld in part under Clause 1.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n22.\nHaving upheld a breach of Clause 1 (i) and Clause 1 (ii), the Committee\nconsidered what remedial action should be required. In circumstances where the\nCommittee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the\npublication of a correction and/or adjudication, the terms and placement of\nwhich is determined by IPSO.\n23. In\ncoming to a view on the appropriate remedy in this case, the Committee\nconsidered the seriousness and extent of the breach of the Code. The Committee\nfound that the publication had not taken the necessary care when reporting the\ncomplainant’s comments to its reporter, and this had led to the publication of\ninaccurate and misleading information, including within the headline of the\nonline article and the accompanying Facebook post. In these circumstances, the\nCommittee considered that the appropriate remedy was the publication of a\ncorrection to put the correct position on the record. \n24. The\nCommittee then considered the placement of this correction. It should also appear\nbeneath the headline of the online article should it remain unamended. If,\nhowever, the article is amended this correction may appear as a footnote,\nrecording the alternations made. This correction should make clear that rising\ncosts had not made the complainants feed their children “nothing but” ready\nmeals as suggested by the original article. It should also make clear that the\nsubstitution of “as” for “when” wrongly suggested that the complainant’s\nchildren were not in school when they otherwise should be and played computer\nor games consoles during that time.\n25. A\nseparate post should also be published making clear that the Committee had\nfound the original Facebook post to be inaccurate, and setting out the correct\nposition. This should be published on the same Facebook account as the original\npost, and remain on the publication’s Facebook feed indefinitely.\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 04/07/2022\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 18/10/2022\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
