It included several photos of the student taken from her\nsocial media profiles. \n3.    The complainant,\nthe deceased’s sister, said that the photographs of her sister used in the\narticle had caused her and her family great distress in breach of Clause 4. The\ncomplainant also said that the article contained excessive detail of a little known\nmethod of suicide, including where it could be bought from and its specific\neffects on the body.\n4.    The publication\ndid not accept that the information published represented a breach of the Code.\nHowever, as a gesture of goodwill, the publication removed the image of the\ncomplainant’s sister on receipt of the complaint. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n5.    Clause 4\n(Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively.

IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n7.    During IPSO’s\ninvestigation, as a gesture of goodwill, the publication offered to remove the\nentire article from its website.\n8.    The complainant\nsaid this would resolve her complaint to her satisfaction.\n9.    As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 06/08/2019\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 26/09/2019\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
