Jack Dewey\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Metro.co.uk\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Paramedic drilled into drunk’s bone without anaesthesia to ‘teach\nhim a lesson’” published on 30 October 2018.\n2. The article was\na report of an incident which took place in Chattanooga, Tennessee. It was\nillustrated with a stock image of a British ambulance.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that the use of this image gave the misleading impression that the\nincident had occurred in the UK, and this was compounded by the fact that any\nreference to the US was only included half way down the article.\n4. The publication\nsaid that there was no intention to offend or mislead, but apologised for any\nconfusion that may have arisen. It replaced the image with one of an American\nambulance.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n7. During IPSO’s\ninvestigation, the publication offered to amend the first sentence of the\narticle to make clear that the story was referring to an American paramedic. It\nalso published the following clarification in its online Corrections and\nClarifications column:\n“An article published on 30 October 2018, on a paramedic who\ndrilled into a drunk’s bone without anaesthesia, inadvertently used a stock\nphotograph of a British ambulance.\nWe are happy to clarify that that this has since been\nreplaced by a photo of a US ambulance to better reflect the content.”\n8. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to his satisfaction.\n9. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 31/10/2018\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 11/01/2019\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
