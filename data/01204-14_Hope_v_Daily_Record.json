Jonathan Hope complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Daily Record had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy)\nof the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Child porn shame of\nfootball agent Jonathan Hope who tried to gag the Daily Record” and “Football\nagent jailed for child porn falsely claimed he was patron of James Bulger\nCharity”, both published on 8 August 2014. \n2. The article headlined “Child porn shame of football\nagent Jonathan Hope who tried to gag the Daily Record” said that the\ncomplainant had a criminal conviction for downloading child pornography, and\nthat the parents of children involved with a youth football team sponsored by\nthe complainant had been “angry” when this had been discovered. It said that he\nhad been convicted in 2003 under the name “Steven Hope”. It also reported that\ndespite his conviction, he had visited an orphanage in 2012. The newspaper said\nthat the complainant claimed in a Radio Five Live interview to have been\ninvolved in the transfer of the footballer Danny Welbeck, but that this had\nbeen denied by the clubs and representatives of the player. The article\nheadlined “Football agent jailed for child porn falsely claimed he was patron\nof James Bulger Charity” reported that the complainant had inaccurately claimed\nto be a patron of a prominent charity. \n3. The complainant said that the coverage had\nmisrepresented his role with the youth football club: he was not actively\ninvolved with the club and did not sponsor the team, although his name had been\nput on the back of the shirts as a gesture for his having found the team a\nsponsor. He also said that, contrary to the claims in the articles, he had been\ntrying to broker a deal between Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur,\nalthough he had not spoken to Mr Welbeck or his representative directly. He\nalso said that the article had inaccurately reported that the orphanage had\nstruggled to contact him after his visit.  Additionally, he had not\nclaimed to have been a patron of the charity, although he had had conversations\nwith senior members of the charity. \n4. The complainant expressed concern that the journalist\nhad used his involvement in football as a means to disclose the fact that he\nhad a spent criminal conviction. \n5. The newspaper said that as the complainant’s name had\nappeared on the back of the youth football club’s shirts, it had not been\nsignificantly misleading to report that he sponsored the club. \n6. After the complainant had been interviewed on the\nradio, Danny Welbeck’s representatives had contacted Radio 5 Live to say that\nthe complainant had not been involved in the deal, even as a middleman. A\nrepresentative of the Welbeck brothers told the newspaper “I will spell out the\nposition of the Welbecks so there is absolutely no room for doubt. Jonathan\nHope is a person we have never heard of, until he went on national radio”. The\nnewspaper had contacted the player’s representatives and the clubs concerned\nwho had confirmed that the complainant had no involvement with the transfer. \n7. The newspaper said that the complainant had claimed on\nfootball forums that he was a patron of the charity. It provided screenshots of\ncomments made by a user named ‘jonathanhope7’, as well as other conversations\nfrom the same user, which it said demonstrated that this was the complainant.\nThe newspaper had also contacted the charity, which said that it had been\napproached by the complainant regarding the position. The complainant denied\nthat he was a contributor, and said that he did not use the website. \n8. The newspaper said that it was entitled to publish\ndetails of the complainant’s conviction, particularly as it was a matter of\npublic concern given his involvement with the children’s football club. \n9. The newspaper raised serious concerns about the\nconduct of the complainant during the course of Ipso’s investigation, including\nallegations that the complainant had sent abusive messages over the internet to\nthe reporter who had provided material for the reports and others under\ncomplaint. These allegations (denied by the complainant) formed the basis of a\ncomplaint to the police and the matter remains under the consideration of the\nProcurator Fiscal as of the date this decision was issued. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n10. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \nFindings of the Committee\n11. The complainant had appeared on the radio, and was\ninterviewed on the premise that he was “the man brokering a deal” for Danny\nWelbeck, and he had not corrected that description of him. During the course of\nthe interview he had suggested that he was actively engaged in the deal, and\nwas in direct discussion with the parties. The reporter subsequently contacted\nthe complainant and the football clubs concerned. As such, the Committee was\nsatisfied that there had not been a failure to take care over the accuracy of\nthe article; there was no breach of Clause 1 (i). The newspaper had been\nentitled to report that the clubs had denied having any involvement with the\ncomplainant. There was no breach of the Code on this point. \n12. The complainant accepted that his name had featured\non the football kit of the youth team in response to his playing a direct role\nin arranging the team’s sponsorship. The article reported concerns raised in\nrelation to his association with children in light of his conviction. In this context,\nit had not been significantly misleading to state that he had sponsored the\nclub. There was no breach of the Code on this point. \n13. In relation to the allegation that the complainant\nhad falsely been claiming to be a patron of the charity, the newspaper had\nprovided screenshots which demonstrated that the claims had been made by a user\nunder the name “jonathanhope7”. It had contacted the charity, which had said\nthat it had been approached by the complainant about being a patron. The\nCommittee was satisfied that there had not been a failure to take care over the\naccuracy of the article, and, given the evidence provided, it did not find that\nthe allegation had been significantly misleading. There was no breach of Clause\n1. \n14. In the context of concerns that the complainant had\nbeen involved with an orphanage despite having a criminal conviction relating\nto child pornography, whether or not the orphanage had subsequently struggled\nto contact the complainant had not been a significant detail such as to warrant\ncorrection under the terms of the Code. \n15. The selection of material for publication is a matter\nfor the discretion of individual editors, provided that such editorial\ndecisions do not engage the terms of the Editors’ Code. It had not been inaccurate\nto report that the complainant had a previous criminal conviction. There was no\nbreach of the Code. \nConclusions\n16. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 27/03/2015\nDate decision issued: 15/05/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
