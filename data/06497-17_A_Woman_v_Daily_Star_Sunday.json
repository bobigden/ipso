A woman complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the\nDaily Star Sunday breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2 (Privacy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Cheat’s £110k high life”,\npublished in February 2017.\n2. The\narticle reported that the complainant had fraudulently claimed £110,000 in\nbenefits while “living the high life”. It said that during a police raid of her\nhouse, the police had found a Porsche and a Mercedes-Benz, and luxury items\nsuch as a hot tub and expensive jewellery. The article was illustrated with a\nphotograph of the complainant’s wedding. It was not published online.\n3. The\ncomplainant said that the newspaper had given an inaccurate impression of her\nlifestyle. She said that she had never owned a designer handbag; the items\nfound during the police raid were either gifts or fakes; and the hot tub had\nbeen bought from ebay. She said that the police had not found two luxury cars\nat her property: she owned a 12-year-old Porsche, and she had previously owned\na 13-year-old Mercedes. \n4. She also\nobjected to the publication of a photograph of her wedding. She said she was\nmarried before she claimed benefits, and it was a basic wedding which she paid\nfor herself.\n5. The\nnewspaper said that the article was an accurate account of the police search\nand the complainant’s appearance at the magistrates’ court. The published\ninformation had been provided by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP),\nwhich had confirmed that its investigators had recovered receipts for luxury\nitems, and that the complainant had a Porsche and before that, she owned a\nMercedes. All of these items had formed part of the evidence bundle used in\ncourt, showing the total of what was found at the complainant’s property.\n6. The\nnewspaper said that in circumstances in which the complainant had pleaded\nguilty in court, there was no obligation to seek her comments before\npublication. \nRelevant Code provisions\n7. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\nFindings of the Committee\n8. The\nnewspaper had accurately reported information it had been provided by a\ncredible source, the DWP, following the complainant’s sentencing in court on charges\nof benefits fraud. While the Committee acknowledged the complainant’s position\nthat the “expensive” items were in fact gifts or fakes, it was accepted that\nshe had owned the jewellery pictured in the article, a hot tub, wallets and\nhandbags. Furthermore, while she had maintained that she had not owned two cars\nat the time of the police raid, she had accepted she owned a Porsche, and prior\nto that, she had owned a Mercedes. In light of this, the Committee did not\nconsider that the newspaper had given a significantly misleading impression of\nthe complainant’s lifestyle while she was making benefit claims. There was no\nfailure to take care over the accuracy of the article on this point. There was\nno breach of Clause 1.\n9. The\nnewspaper had published a photograph of the complainant taken on her wedding\nday. She was not engaged in a private activity at the time the photograph was\ntaken, and the image had not disclosed any private information about her. There\nwas no breach of Clause 2.\nConclusion\n10. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.Date complaint received: 20/04/2017Date decision issued: 10/07/2017 \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
