Ross Aitchison complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that Evening Times breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Use this election to send\nthe SNP a clear message”, published on 2 December 2019.\n2. The article was an opinion piece by a Scottish\nConservative & Unionist Councillor commenting on the SNP at the 2019\nGeneral Election. The article was a personal account of the Councillor’s\nexperiences of the Scottish Independence referendum and his opinions on\nunionism and independence. The article claimed that “The watershed moment for\nme was Alex Salmond loudly stating that ‘Scotland’s youth backs independence’.\nThis couldn’t be further from the truth.” It also stated that Labour had\npromised to hold two referendums in 2020.\n3. The article also appeared online in substantially the\nsame format.\n4. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1. The complainant said that the article had not clearly\ndistinguished between comment and fact, nor had it made clear that it was\nwritten by an elected Conservative Councillor, and was therefore in breach of\nClause 1(iv). Furthermore, he said that it was inaccurate to report that\nScotland’s youth do not back independence, as both independent polls and the\nresults of the 2014 independence referendum showed that the majority of under\n35s wanted independence. He also said that it was inaccurate to say that Labour\nhad promised a second referendum when the Labour manifesto explicitly stated\nthat there would be no Scottish independence referendum in the early years of a\nLabour government.\n5. The publication said it did not accept that there had\nbeen a breach of Clause 1. It said that the article had clearly been labelled\nas a comment piece, and that the caption of the picture made clear that it had\nbeen written by a Conservative Councillor. It said that “Scotland’s youth backs\nindependence” was the opinion of the columnist, and as the Prime Minister often\nstated that Labour had promised two elections this was fair comment.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading\nor distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the\ntext.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n7. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n8. The publication offered to print the following\ncorrection:\nEuan Blockley's comment that Scotland's youth supporting\nindependence \"could not be further from the truth\" is his personal\nview only.\nLabour did not promise two referendums – however, the\nConservative Party claimed Labour would hold two in order to facilitate a deal\nwith the SNP.\n9. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto his satisfaction.\n10. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 02/12/2019\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 04/02/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
