The article reported\ncomments from the woman’s parents regarding the couple’s relationship; they\nalso alleged that they had received letters from the Child Maintenance Service\n“demanding they pay child maintenance for her”. The article reported certain\nbiographical details about the woman, as well as information about the couple’s\nmarriage. 3.    The complainant, the unnamed\nwoman referred to in the article, said that the article represented an\nintrusion into her privacy, and her time at school. She said that she was\nidentifiable from the information contained in the article, namely the\npublication of the name of her husband, her parents, and biographical details\nabout her. The complainant also said that it was inaccurate, in breach of\nClause 1, for the article to have claimed that her husband had “demanded” child\nsupport from her parents; she said that the DWP had confirmed that a claim had\nbeen issued due to an administrative error. 4.    The publication did not accept a\nbreach of the Code. It noted that the complainant was not named in the article,\nand all images of her were obscured in order to limit direct identification. It\nalso said that a person’s marriage is a matter\nof public record and is not a private matter. The publication said\nthat, furthermore, all of the\ninformation provided in the article was given by the complainant's maternal\nparents. It said that the complainant’s parents were entitled to speak to the\npress about their experience and, as parents, had given consent to the\npublication of information regarding their daughter. \nRelevant\nCode Provisions 5.    Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The Press must\ntake care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or\nimages, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A significant\ninaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and\nwith due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In cases\ninvolving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair\nopportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for. \niv) The Press,\nwhile free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between\ncomment, conjecture and fact. \nClause 2\n(Privacy)* \ni) Everyone is\nentitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and correspondence,\nincluding digital communications.\nii) Editors will\nbe expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without\nconsent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy,\naccount will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of\ninformation and the extent to which the material complained about is already in\nthe public domain or will become so.\niii) It is\nunacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or\nprivate places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. \nClause 6 (Children)* \ni) All pupils\nshould be free to complete their time at school without unnecessary intrusion.\nii) They must not\nbe approached or photographed at school without permission of the school authorities.\niii) Children\nunder 16 must not be interviewed or photographed on issues involving their own\nor another child’s welfare unless a custodial parent or similarly responsible\nadult consents. \nMediated\noutcome 6.    The complaint was not resolved\nthrough direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an\ninvestigation into the matter. 7.    During IPSO’s investigation, the\npublication offered to remove the article from its website, as a gesture of\ngoodwill, which the complainant confirmed resolved the complaint to her\nsatisfaction. 8.    As the complaint was successfully\nmediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether\nthere had been any breach of the Code. Date\ncomplaint received: 07/05/2019Date\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 19/06/2019\n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
