Nicola\nGomersall complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation on behalf\nof herself and her husband, Kevin Gomersall, that leeds-live.co.uk breached\nClause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined\n“Struggling Leeds couple forced to feed kids nothing but ready meals and sell\noff possessions”, published on 1 July 2022.\n2. The\narticle was based on an interview with the complainant and her husband in which\nthey discussed the rising cost of living. It reported that the couple said\nrising costs have “caused their lives to become a misery”, with them “having to\nfeed their kids cheap ready-meals, stay in all the time as they can’t afford to\nout go [and] spending £50 a week just to take one child to school”. It reported\nthat “energy costs have been through the roof for the large family [with five\nchildren] on their various computer or games consoles throughout the day as\nthey’re off school”. It quoted the complainant saying, “With all the prices\ngoing up, its going to become a choice of eating or taking your kids to\nschool”, with her husband adding “[f]ood, gas, electric everything has gone up\n[…] [o]ur kids don’t eat as healthy anymore because it costs too much for food.\nWe’re giving them ready meals, something quick and simple”. It quoted the\ncomplainant’s husband saying: “It’s a bit of a nightmare. We don’t even get to\ngo out anymore. We basically have to sit in because we have no money to pay.”\nIt also reported that the complainant said the rising fuel costs meant it “cost\n£50 a week just to take their 15-year-old child” to school. It stated that this\nchild attended “Tadcaster Grammar” and was “on the waiting list for the school\nbus”.\n3. The\narticle was accompanied by three photographs of the couple at the a car boot\nsale, captioned, respectively: “Parents Kevin and Nicola Gomersall have been\nstruggling with the cost of living crisis”; “Kevin and Nicola were selling\ntheir possessions at Wetherby Car Boot Sale”; and “Kevin and Nicola have been\npaying £50 a week just to take one child to school in Tadcaster”\n4. The\narticle was also promoted on the publication’s Facebook page under the headline\n“Leeds couple’s ‘nightmare’ as they are forced to feed children ‘nothing but\nready meals’”. It was shared with an image of the complainant and her husband\nand was shared with a status which read: “They face a mountain of bills and\ncan’t afford to go out [sad emoji].\"\n5. The\ncomplainant said the article misrepresented the comments she and her husband\nhad made to the journalist. The complainant said that they did not tell the\nreporter that their family were “struggling” and “miserable”; could “only\nafford to feed their kids cheap ready meals”; and needed to sell off their\npossessions.  She said that the article\ninaccurately and misleadingly reported that her children played their various\n“computer and games consoles” throughout the day “as they’re off school”. While\nshe accepted that her children played with these devices in their spare time,\nthey each attended school; they were not out of school and playing on these\nconsoles as the article suggested. She also said the article was inaccurate to\nreport that her 15-year-old son attended “Tadcaster Grammar” and was on the\n“waiting list for the school bus”. While the complainant accepted that another\none of her children attended this school and was waiting for a place on the\nschool bus, her 15-year-old son attended a separate school, Wetherby School,\nand already had a place on the school bus.\n6. The\npublication did not accept a breach of the Editors’ Code. The publication said\nthat the article was an accurate report of the interview with the complainant\nand her husband, and provided an audio recording of the interview to IPSO to\ndemonstrate this as well as the reporter’s notes. It added that the complainant\nand her husband had consented to an interview with the journalist, with the\nreporter identifying which publication they represented and the purpose of the\ninterview: to discuss the cost-of-living crisis its impact on families with\nsellers at the car boot sale.\n7. The\npublication said both the audio recording and reporter’s notes showed that the\ncomplainant had discussed the increasing costs and difficulties faced by their\nfamily, with the complainant’s husband saying that the extra money made from\nthe car boot sales did “help”. In the recording, the complainant’s husband said\nit was “tough” with “everything going up” including “food”, “petrol, gas [and]\nelectric”. The reporter asked whether the complainant and her husband were\n“feeling the strain” of feeding a family with five children to which the\ncomplainant’s husband agreed. The reporter then asked what “sort of changes”\nthe pair had had to make as a consequence of rising cost, with the\ncomplainant’s husband saying that the “kids [do] not eat as healthy anymore as\nit costs too much [..] so we are giving them ready meals”. In the recording,\nthe complainant’s husband also said “[i]t’s a nightmare […] we don’t even get\nto go out anymore […] we are basically sat in because we have no money at all\nand made reference to “arguments”: “When you’re living with each other, it\ncauses a lot of arguments. You get angry. You need your space.”\n8. Notwithstanding\nthis, upon receipt of a direct complaint from the complainant, the publication,\nin a gesture of goodwill, amended the headline of the online article to from\n\"Struggling Leeds couple forced to feed kids nothing but ready meals and sell\noff possessions” to \"Struggling Leeds couple forced to feed kids ready\nmeals and sell off possessions”.\n9. The\npublication did not accept that the article was inaccurate or misleading to\nreport that the complainant‘s children were “on their various computers or\ngames consoles throughout the day as they’re off school”. In the recording, the\ncomplainant and her husband also made reference to “game consoles” and the cost\nof electricity: “In our house, we have all the computers going […] when the kids\nare off school […] our electric is through the roof”. Further, the publication\nsaid it was clear that the children were currently on their summer holidays.\n10. In\naddition, the publication accepted that complainant had been referring to a\ndifferent child in her interview; her “15-year-old” child did not attend\n“Tadcaster Grammar”. While the publication did not accept that this amounted to\na significant inaccuracy, it offered to amend the online article and to publish\nthe following footnote correction:\n“A\nprevious version of this article reported that the child that attended\nTadcaster Grammar School was 15. In fact, this child is 13 years old. We are\nhappy to clarify this”\n11. The\ncomplainant did not consider that the amendments to the online article and\nfootnote correction were adequate. The complainant expressed concern that the\nwording did not address her primary concerns that the article had misrepresented\nher and her husband’s comments and did not include an apology for the\ninaccuracies.\n12. In\nresponse to the audio recording provided by the publication, the complainant\nsaid that it had been edited. For example, it omitted her response when her husband\ntold the reporter that he gave their children ready meals: “I have never given\nthem ready meals, you cheeky sod”.\n13. The\npublication denied that the audio recording had been interfered with or altered\nin any way.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly\nand with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In\ncases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n14. In\nconsidering the accuracy of the article, the Committee had regard for the\nreporter’s notes and the audio recording provided by the publication. The\nCommittee noted the complainant’s position that the audio recording had been\nedited to remove something that she had said. However, in the absence of any\nspecific evidence in support of this position, and there was not, to the\nregular listener, any suggestion in the recording that it had been edited, the\nCommittee proceeded on the grounds that the audio file was an unedited\nrecording of the complainant’s conversation with the reporter. The Committee\nthen turned to consider whether the article had accurately reported the\ncomments made by the complainant and her husband in that recording.\n15. The\nheadline of the article, and the accompanying Facebook post, reported that the\ncouple had been “forced to feed [their] kids nothing but ready meals”. However,\nthe audio recording of the interview did not support this assertion. While the\ncomplainant and her husband had indicated that due to higher food prices they\nhad changed their family’s eating habits and were now feeding their children\nready meals; they did not, in any way, suggest that they been forced to feed\ntheir kids “nothing but” ready meals. The headline claim did not reflect the\ncomplainant’s comments and consequently gave the clear and misleading\nimpression that their children’s diet consisted solely of this particular\ncategory of food. On this basis, the publication had failed to take care not to\npublish inaccurate and misleading information in breach of Clause 1(i).\n16. In\nthe particular context of an interview with two parents where the claim related\nto the quality of food that they were giving their children this inaccuracy was\nconsidered significant by the Committee: it distorted the complainant’s\ncomments during the interview and suggested that the couple had been forced to\nfeed their children “nothing but” ready meals, which they had not. It therefore\nrequired correction under Clause 1 (ii). While the Committee noted that the\nheadline of the online article had been amended to address this point, no\nclarification or correction had been offered by the publication. There was\ntherefore a breach of Clause 1 (ii).\n17. The\nCommittee then consider whether the article was inaccurate to report that the\ncomplainant’s children were on “various computer or games consoles throughout\nthe day as they’re off school”.  In the\nrecording, the complainant’s husband told the reporter “when the kids are off\nschool” they have “all the computers going” and as a consequence of this the\n“electric [was] through the roof”. However, the article had misreported the\nquotation; substituting “as” for “when” and in so doing wrongly suggested that\nthe complainant’s children were not in school when they otherwise should be and\nplaying on computer consoles during that time. This statement was not supported\nby the audio recording or the reporter’s notes. On this basis, the publication\nhad not taken sufficient care over the accuracy of the complainant’s comments\nin breach of Clause 1 (i).\n18. In\nthe view of the Committee, the suggestion that the complainant’s children were\nnot at school when they should be was significant and required correction under\nClause 1 (ii). As no correction had been offered, this represented a further\nbreach of Clause 1(ii).\n19. The\nCommittee next considered the complainant’s concerns that the article reported\nthat her and her husband were “struggling”; had been forced to “sell off” their\npossessions; and that increased costs had made their lives a “misery”. The\nCommittee noted that the interview had been conducted at a car boot sale where\nthe complainant was selling items. In addition, the Committee noted that,\nduring the interview, the complainant’s husband said that the extra money made\nfrom the sales did “help” with rising costs. Further, the Committee noted the\ncomplainant and her husband had stated during the interview that increasing\ncosts were making life “tough” and “a nightmare”; actively agreed that their\nfamily were feeling the “strain”; and referred to “arguments”. In this context,\nthe Committee was satisfied that the comments made by the couple, and relied\nupon by the publication, provided a sufficient basis for the manner in which\nthe publication had summarised and characterised the complainant’s position; it\nwas not a failure to take care over the accuracy of the article to report that\nthe couple were “struggling”; had been “forced” to “sell” their possessions;\nand their lives were a “misery”. Further, the Committee did not consider that\nthe publication’s summary of the comments made by the complainant and her\nhusband were significantly inaccurate or misleading. There was no breach of\nClause 1 on these points.\n20.\nFinally, the Committee did not consider reporting that the complainant’s\n“15-year-old” child attended Tadcaster Grammar School rendered the article\ninaccurate or misleading. The section of the article where this statement\nappeared had focused on the practicalities and costs of transporting one of the\ncomplainant’s children to school. Taken in this context, and where it was not\nin dispute that another of the complainant’s children attended this particular\nschool and was waiting for a place on the school bus, the misreporting of the\nage of the child did not constitute a failure to take care or represent a\nsignificant inaccuracy requiring correction under Clause 1. Notwithstanding\nthis, the Committee welcomed the publication’s offer to publish a footnote correction\naddressing this point.   \nConclusion(s)\n21. The\ncomplaint was upheld in part under Clause 1.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n22.\nHaving upheld a breach of Clause 1 (i) and Clause 1 (ii), the Committee\nconsidered what remedial action should be required. In circumstances where the\nCommittee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the\npublication of a correction and/or adjudication, the terms and placement of\nwhich is determined by IPSO.\n23. In\ncoming to a view on the appropriate remedy in this case, the Committee\nconsidered the seriousness and extent of the breach of the Code. The Committee\nfound that the publication had not taken the necessary care when reporting the\ncomplainant’s comments to its reporter, and this had led to the publication of\ninaccurate and misleading information, including within the headline of the\nonline article and the accompanying Facebook post. In these circumstances, the\nCommittee considered that the appropriate remedy was the publication of a correction\nto put the correct position on the record.\n24. The\nCommittee then considered the placement of this correction. In relation to the\nonline article, the headline of which had already been amended, this should\nappear as a footnote. This correction should make clear that rising costs had\nnot forced the complainants to feed their children “nothing but” ready meals as\nsuggested by the original article. It should also make clear that the\nsubstitution of “as” for “when” wrongly suggested that the complainant’s\nchildren were not in school when they otherwise should be and played computer\nand game consoles during that time.\n25. A\nseparate post should also be published making clear that the Committee had\nfound the original Facebook post to be inaccurate, and setting out the correct\nposition. This should be published on the same Facebook account as the original\npost, and remain on the publication’s Facebook feed indefinitely.\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 21/07/2022\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 18/10/2022\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
