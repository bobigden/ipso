Irish comedian jumped down from the stage\nand performed the HEIMLICH manoeuvre on fan, 29, who was choking on an M&M\nin his gig”, published on 1 February 2018. 2.   \nThe\narticle reported that a comedian had saved the life of a woman “when he jumped\noffstage mid-performance and performed the Heimlich manoeuvre after spotting\nher choking on an M&M”. It said that the woman, who was named and whose age\nwas given, had been eating the snack at a theatre in Bradford, when it became\nlodged in her throat. The article included a photograph of the woman apparently\nat the gig with her friend, and included extensive quotations from her\ndescribing the incident. She explained that she was “within seconds of passing\nout” when the comedian “saved” her. The article also included several\nphotographs of the comedian. 3.   \nThe\narticle was removed from the publication’s website the day it was published,\nafter the publication found that the comedian had denied the central claim of the\nstory. 4.   \nThe\ncomplainant said that the article was wholly inaccurate, in breach of Clause 1\n(Accuracy). He said that the incident it reported on had never occurred, and\nthat the comedian had confirmed this. He said that the publication had failed\nto take sufficient care over the accuracy of the article, and had failed to\ncorrect the inaccuracy it contained because no correction or clarification had\nbeen published. 5.   \nThe\npublication denied that it had failed to take care over the accuracy of the\narticle, in breach of Clause 1(i) of the Code. It had received the story via an\nunsolicited email from a named member of the public. It had responded by asking\nthe individual to describe what had happened; she had then provided the date,\ntime and location of the event, as well as the details of her alleged story.\nThe publication had then asked the individual to provide photographs and a\ncontact telephone number, and she provided several photos, one of which claimed\nto show her at the comedy gig. The individual had declined to provide a\ntelephone number, but this was not uncommon for members of the public who might\nbe uncomfortable speaking with journalists. The publication had then sought\nfurther biographical details from the individual, including her age, where she\nlived and her job; the individual had provided this information. No payment was\nmade to this individual, and there was no reason to disbelieve the story; the\npublication said that the use of tips in this way was standard practice.\nBecause the story was light-hearted, and showed the comedian in a good light,\nthere was no obligation under the Code to put the allegations to him prior to\npublication. 6.   \nThe\npublication also denied that it had failed to meet the obligation imposed by\nClause 1(ii) of the Code to promptly correct inaccurate information. It said\nthat the article was removed 14 hours after it was published, because it was\ncontacted by the woman pictured in the article, who said she was not the woman\nnamed in the article, and had no knowledge of the events reported. The\npublication then contacted another publication which had run the story, and\nfound that the comedian had repudiated the article’s claims. The publication then\ncontacted the individual who had provided the story, who maintained that it was\naccurate. However, the decision was made to remove the article at this point.\nThe publication said that removing an article was an appropriate approach to\ncorrecting an inaccurate piece, and that the original complainant was satisfied\nwith this outcome. Nevertheless, the publication offered to publish the\nfollowing clarification: On January 3 we\npublished an article with the headline “Ed Byrne saved my life!” which reported\nclaims that the comedian saved a fan from choking on an M7M using the Heimlich\nmanoeuvre during his stand-up show in Bradford. The information was received\nand published in good faith. Nevertheless, after publication Mr Byrne said on\nsocial media that the claims were “completely untrue” and the article was\nswiftly withdrawn. We are happy to set the record straight. 7.   \nThe\ncomplainant did not consider that the publication’s offer was adequate: he had\ncontacted the publication three days after the article was published, and a\ncorrection had not been offered until three months later. This did not\nrepresent a ‘prompt’ correction. 8.   \nThe\npublication said that the complainant’s initial contact had been interpreted as\na media enquiry; his email had been headed “Blogger inquiry”. When it received\nthe complainant’s substantive complaint from IPSO, it offered a correction\nwithin 10 days. \nRelevant Code\nProvisions 9. Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text. ii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator.  \nFindings\nof the Committee 10.   \nThe publication had published an\narticle based on a tip from a member of the public. It had subsequently taken\nsome steps to verify this information, including asking for details of the time\nand location of the alleged events; seeking biographical details about the\nindividual; and asking for photographs of her. The story did not make any\nnegative or damaging claims about the comedian, and the publication had no\nreason to believe that the individual was misleading it, in circumstances where\nno money was being exchanged. Therefore, in this instance, the Committee\nconsidered that there had been no failure to take care over the publication of\nthe article, and no breach of Clause 1(i). 11. The\nCommittee then considered whether the publication had met its obligation, under\nClause 1(ii), to correct significant published inaccuracies. The comedian who\nwas the subject of the article had stated that the article’s central claim that\nhe had performed the Heimlich manoeuvre on a fan was “completely untrue”.  Because this claim was central to the article,\nthis represented a significant inaccuracy - regardless of the nature of the\npiece. A correction was therefore required to avoid a breach of Clause 1(ii).\nThe publication had offered a wording which made clear that the comedian had\ndenied that the incident had occurred. This corrected the inaccuracy the\narticle had contained. The correction had been offered shortly after the\ncomplaint was passed to the publication by IPSO, and the complainant’s initial\ncontacts with the publication had not been presented as a complaint, but as a\nmedia enquiry; the promptness of the offer of correction was therefore\nsufficient. The publication had offered to publish the correction in its\nclarifications and corrections column at the top of its news page, for a period\nof 24 hours, before archiving it in the usual way; this was sufficiently\nprominent given that the article had appeared online for only 14 hours. The\nwording, prominence, and promptness of the offered correction were therefore\nsufficient, and there was no breach of Clause 1(ii). This correction should now\nbe published. Conclusions 12. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial action\nrequired 13. N/A.The complainant complained to the\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling\nthis complaint. The Independent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process\nwas not flawed and did not uphold the request for review.\nDate complaint\nreceived: 09/04/2018\nDate decision issued: 27/07/2018\n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
