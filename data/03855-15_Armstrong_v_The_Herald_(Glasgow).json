Paul Armstrong complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation on behalf of James Armstrong that The Herald (Glasgow)\nhad breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 3 (Privacy) Clause 4 (Harassment) and\nClause 5 (Intrusion into Grief or Shock) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Schoolgirl dies from cancer as older brother battles\ndisease”, published on 21 January 2015. \n2. The complainant’s niece, Ellie Armstrong, died on 18\nJanuary 2015. This article was based on copy by a news agency, and was\npublished in a number of media outlets. It reported that Ellie Armstrong had\ndied of cancer, and that Cameron Armstrong, her brother, had revealed on\nTwitter that he had been diagnosed with the disease. It was largely based on\ninformation from social media. This included information from Ellie’s Facebook\npage, and expressions of condolences from her classmates. It also reported on\ncharity fundraising the complainant had undertaken while Ellie was ill. The\ncomplainant was complaining on behalf of James Armstrong, the father of Ellie\nand her brother Cameron. \n3. The complainant said that this article was researched\nand published in a manner which intruded into the grief of the Armstrong\nfamily. He was concerned that it was based on information taken from social\nmedia, and said that it contained inaccuracies as to the nature of Ellie’s\ntreatment. He said that approaches by the reporter to members of his family\nconstituted harassment. \n4. The complainant said that the reporter made three\ncalls to a hair salon owned by the complainant’s wife, Angela Armstrong, on 20\nJanuary. Two of these calls were in the morning, prior to publication of a\nversion of the article, and the third was at 2pm, after publication. James\nArmstrong contacted the reporter at around 1pm after a version of the article\nappeared online, and he had been made aware that she was pursuing the story.\nThe complainant said that Mr Armstrong asked the reporter to stop pursuing the\nstory, and asked her not to contact the family, who wanted privacy to grieve\nfor their daughter. The complainant said that he was at this time making\nEllie’s funeral arrangements. The reporter did not agree to stop pursuing the\nstory, and Mr Armstrong ended the call abruptly.  The complainant said\nthat the reporter then made the third call to the salon, and told the employee\nwho answered that she had spoken to Mr Armstrong, and asked if she could\nclarify some information he had given her. The complainant said that this was\ndeceitful; it gave the impression that Mr Armstrong had consented to the story.\nHe said that the third call to the salon, after Mr Armstrong had asked the\nreporter not to contact the family, was harassment under the terms of Clause 4\n(Harassment). \n5. Mr Armstrong also spoke to the news agency’s editor\nlater in the afternoon. He asked him not to continue with the story and told\nhim that it contained inaccuracies, and that its publication would be\ndistressing for the family. The editor said that the agency would be proceeding\nwith the story, but that he would amend any inaccuracies. The complainant said\nthat the decision to proceed with the story without the family’s consent was\ninsensitive and intrusive where only two days had passed since  Ellie’s\ndeath, and while her brother was very ill in hospital. \n6. The article said that “it is believed” that Ellie’s\ntreatment had been going on for “well over” a year. The complainant said that\nthis was inaccurate; Ellie’s treatment lasted for the 10 months before her\ndeath. The article referred to Lisa Armstrong, Ellie’s mother, as “Lisa\nMcGuire”, which was in fact her maiden name. The complainant said that it\nincluded information which had been taken from Ellie’s Facebook page; Ellie was\n14 years old, and would not have been aware that this information could be used\nin this way. In relation to reporting Cameron’s comments on social media, the\ncomplainant said that there was a difference between disclosing information on\nan account for friends and family to read, and the same information being\nincluded in a newspaper article to which you did not consent. \n7. The newspaper said that it published the article,\nwhich it had taken in good faith from a news agency, and was not aware ahead of\npublication that the family did not want it to be published. It said that it\ndid not contact Ellie’s family because the agency copy included a statement\nfrom the headmaster of Ellie’s school, which had been issued with the approval\nof Ellie’s mother. The newspaper offered to publish in the print edition of the\nnewspaper an apology for the distress caused to the family by the publication\nof the article.  It offered to correct the use of Lisa Armstrong’s maiden\nname. \n8. The newspaper said that the agency reporter first\ncalled the business owned by Ellie’s aunt after seeing a donation on the\ncomplainant’s Just Giving page. The donation page noted that it was from the\nclients and staff of a hair salon, and that it had been made by “A\nArmstrong”.  The reporter spoke to someone who worked at the salon, who\nagreed to pass on her number to the family. She called back an hour later to\nask if her number had been passed on, and to see if anyone at the salon was\nwilling to talk to her about what had happened. She was told by the employee\nthat the number had been passed on, but that she didn’t think anyone at the\nbusiness would want to comment. A version of the article was then published\nonline. The reporter then received a call from Mr Armstrong, who told her that\nthe story contained inaccuracies, but provided no further detail. Mr Armstrong\nended the phone call before she had a chance to explain anything further, and\nthere was no request that she should leave the family alone.  Following\nthis call, she called the salon for a third time, to enquire whether anyone at\nthe salon would be willing to clarify what the inaccuracies were. She did not\ntry to suggest that the family had consented to the story. The person the\njournalist spoke to said that she did not want to help, and asked that she did\nnot call them again.  Later that evening, Mr Armstrong contacted the\neditor of the news agency. He told him that there were inaccuracies in the\nstory, but did not specify what they were. \n9. The newspaper said that Cameron had stated on his\npublic Twitter page that he had cancer and that he was going to fight it; these\ntweets had been re-tweeted hundreds of times. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n10. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving the\nRegulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance. \niii) The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nClause 3 (Privacy) \ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. \nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into\nany individual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information. \nClause 4 (Harassment) \ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation,\nharassment or persistent pursuit. \nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on their\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent. \niii) Editors must ensure these principles are observed by\nthose working for them and take care not to use non-compliant material from\nother sources. \nClause 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock) \ni) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries\nand approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication\nhandled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings, such as inquests. \nFindings of the Committee\n11. The Committee expressed its condolences to the\nArmstrong family for their loss. It understood that this complaint related to\nevents which took place at a very difficult time for the family. \n12. Personal tragedy may be the subject of legitimate\nmedia coverage, and the Committee noted that in this instance, the matter was\nalready being discussed in the public domain by members of the community in\nwhich Ellie lived. While the Code requires that newspapers research and publish\nsuch articles in a manner which is sensitive to the personal grief of those\nclose to the deceased, this does not create a requirement that the family must\nconsent to publication or an absolute prohibition on journalists approaching\nthe family for comment.  The Committee fully recognised that Ellie’s\nfamily did not at that time want the newspaper to report on her death, but this\ndid not provide grounds for establishing a breach of Clause 5.  It was not\ninappropriate for the reporter to ask the hair salon to pass on her contact details\nto the immediate family, nor were the calls to the hair salon indiscreet, or\nunsympathetic. In addition, the information taken from social media was\npublicly available, and was not of a private or inappropriate nature. In these\ncircumstances, the inclusion of this material was not intrusive or insensitive.\nThese aspects of the complaint did not raise a breach of Clause 3 or Clause 5. \n13. During the reporter’s second telephone call to the\nsalon, she was told by an employee that she did not think anyone at the salon\nwould want to comment, but she was not asked not to call the salon again. The\ncomplainant said that following this contact, James Armstrong told the\njournalist that she should not contact his family. In assessing whether there\nwas a breach of Clause 4 in relation to the journalist’s subsequent call to the\nsalon, the Committee took into account the full circumstances. While an\nemployee of the salon had previously said that they did not think anyone would\nwant to comment, the Committee noted the journalist’s explanation that she had\ncalled the salon to seek clarification on the inaccuracies Mr Armstrong had\nmade her aware of. There was no indication that the third call was a further\nattempt to contact Ellie’s parents or siblings. In these circumstances, the\nCommittee considered that the third call to the salon did not amount to\nharassment under the terms of Clause 4. \n14. The Committee acknowledged the complainant’s concern\nthat the article reported inaccurately on the duration of Ellie’s treatment. However,\nin the context of the article, the exact duration of her illness was not a\nsignificant detail, and this inaccuracy did not provide grounds for\nestablishing a breach of Clause 1. The use of Lisa Armstrong’s maiden name,\nwhile a matter of regret, did not raise a significant inaccuracy. As such,\nwhilst the Committee acknowledged the distress these inaccuracies caused, it\ndid not establish a breach of Clause 1.  \nConclusions\n15. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 28/05/2015\nDate decision Issued: 04/08/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
