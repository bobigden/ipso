It reported on the circumstances\nsurrounding the criminal proceedings, including comments made in court by the\nprosecution that “in interview, [the complainant] was to say he was obsessed\nwith suicide”. The article also reported that “earlier this year [the\ncomplainant] was hospitalised after a bicycle crash left him in a critical\ncondition, although he has since made a full recovery”. 3.   \nThe\ncomplainant said that he had not made a full recovery and that he had become\nseverely disabled as a result of the bicycle accident. He said that during\ncourt proceedings the judge had stated that he was disabled and required\nspecial measures as a result. The complainant said that the misreporting of\nthis information represented a breach of Clause 1 and 4 of the Code. He also\nsaid that the article had intruded into his private life, in breach of Clause\n2, because it reported that he had been suicidal; he said that this was a\nprivate medical matter. 4.   \nThe\npublication did not accept that it had breached the Code. It said that the\ninformation that the complainant had made a full recovery was based on the\nimages of him attending court. Given the severity of the incident, and the fact\nthat the complainant was able to walk unaided into court, it was assumed by the\njournalist that he had recovered from his injuries. Following publication, the\njournalist had informed the publication that there was some pre-trial\ndiscussion between the judge and legal teams about how the trial was to\nproceed. It was mentioned that the complainant was fit to stand trial but still\nhad “some problems” because of the accident, and he was told that if he wished\nto take a break then this would be granted. The publication said that as this\nwas an informal conversation, the journalist did not take or retain notes and\nthe information was not included in the copy sent to it; it merely had the\nimages to represent the extent of the complainant’s physical recuperation. 5.   \nIn\nresponse to the complainant’s concerns, the publication removed the reference\nto his “full recovery” from the article. It said that in any event, it was a\npassing reference and did not materially affect the remainder of the article. The\npublication said that given that the practical consequences of the complainant not\nbeing fully recovered were a short discussion before proceedings began, the\nremoval of this information alone was sufficient. 6.   \nThe\npublication said that the article did not state that the complainant had been\nsuicidal, rather it referred to suicide only in the context that it was heard\nin court. It said that such information was already in the public domain and\nits publication did not represent an intrusion into the complainant’s private\nlife. 7.   \nThe\npublication also did not accept that there was a failure to handle publication\nsensitively. Nevertheless, it offered to publish the following clarification as\na footnote to the online article: “A\nprevious version of this article stated that Dr Crichton had made a full\nrecovery after being hospitalised due to a bicycle crash. We have since been\nadvised that, in fact, he has been left with major disabilities from the\nresulting brain injury and numerous surgeries which followed his severe\nphysical injuries”. \nRelevant Code Provisions 8.   \nClause\n1 (Accuracy) i)     \nThe\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text. ii)    \nA\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. iii)   \nA\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for. iv)   \nThe\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact. v)    \nA\npublication must report fairly and accurately the outcome of an action for\ndefamation to which it has been a party, unless an agreed settlement states\notherwise, or an agreed statement is published. Clause 2 (Privacy)* i)     \nEveryone\nis entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and\ncorrespondence, including digital communications. ii)    \nEditors\nwill be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life\nwithout consent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy, account will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of\ninformation and the extent to which the material complained about is already in\nthe public domain or will become so. iii)   \nIt\nis unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or\nprivate places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or\nshock) In cases involving personal grief\nor shock, enquiries and approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion\nand publication handled sensitively. These provisions should not restrict the\nright to report legal proceedings.\nFindings\nof the Committee 9.   \nThe\npublication had based its information that the complainant had made a “full\nrecovery” from his bicycle accident, solely on the fact that the reporter had seen\nhim walk unaided into court. The publication did not take any further steps to\ncorroborate this claim, which represented a failure to take care not to publish\ninaccurate information. There was a breach of Clause 1 (i). The complainant\nsaid that he had in fact been left severely disabled as a result of the bicycle\naccident. The article was a court report and the information that the\ncomplainant had made a “full recovery” had not been referred to as part of the\ncourt proceedings, but his circumstances were discussed prior to the\nproceedings. Given that the article had inaccurately reported a significant\nclaim about the complainant’s health, in the context of a court report, the\nCommittee considered that this was a significant inaccuracy which required\ncorrection under the terms of Clause 1 (ii). 10. Shortly after the publication\nbecame aware of the complainant’s concerns, it had offered to publish a\ncorrection as a footnote to the article. This correction highlighted the\ninaccurate information, that the complainant had made a full recovery, and made\nthe correct position clear, that he had been left severely disabled as a result\nof the accident. The Committee considered that this was sufficient to meet the\npublication’s obligations as set out under Clause 1 (ii), and there was no\nfurther breach of the Code on this point. 11. The complainant did not dispute\nthat he had been charged with sending a malicious communication, including\nmaking a phone call with the intention of making another individual fear that he\nwould commit suicide, or that the prosecution had made the comment in court\nthat he had previously said that he was “obsessed with suicide”. The publication\nwas entitled to report this information which was heard in open court. The\nCommittee did not consider that its publication represented an intrusion into\nthe complainant’s private life, and noted that the article did not report as\nfact that the complainant was in a suicidal state of mind. There was no breach\nof Clause 2. 12. Clause 4 states that in cases involving\ngrief or shock, enquiries and approaches must be made with sympathy and\ndiscretion, and publication handled sensitively. The Committee noted that the\nissues raised in the article were personal to the complainant. However, the\nCommittee considered that the purpose of Clause 4 is to provide protections to\nindividuals during times of grief or shock, following tragic events or trauma.\nIn this instance, it considered that the complainant had not been in a state of\n“grief or shock” such as would engage the terms of Clause 4. \nConclusions 13. The complaint was upheld in part\nunder Clause 1 (i).\nRemedial\nAction Required 14. The Committee had established a\nbreach of Clause 1 (i). As such, it considered the remedial action which the\npublication should be required to undertake in order to remedy the breach. 15. The publication had promptly\noffered to publish a clarification as a footnote to the online article. The\nCommittee considered that the clarification was sufficient to meet the terms of\nClause 1 (ii). The clarification should now be published, subject to the\ncomplainant’s consent. Date complaint received: 20/08/2018Date decision issued: 15/11/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
