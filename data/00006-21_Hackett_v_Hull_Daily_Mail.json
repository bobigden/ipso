William\nHackett complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Hull\nDaily Mail breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Parent's anger over last-minute U-turn decision to close\nschool”, published on 4 January 2021.\n2. The\narticle, which appeared on page 8 of the newspaper, reported that a primary\nschool would not be reopening after the Christmas break, “despite parents being\nurged by the government to send kids to school.” It said that parents at the\nprimary school had received an email “advising that pupils should not come back\nto school on Tuesday.” The article then went on to quote the email in full; the\nemail stated that union opposition to teachers returning to schools was “going\nto have an impact on us at [school] and how we arrange learning over the next\nfew weeks. Our Senior Leadership Team is currently taking stock of the\nsituation and will be looking at how we can arrange learning in the short term\nas we await further developments from the Government and the Unions.” A further\nquote from the email stated: “When we have made arrangements we will let you\nknow exactly what is happening as soon as we can. It may be wise to start\nthinking about alternative arrangements for child care and how your children\nwill engage in online learning if we have to close.”\n3. The\narticle also appeared online in substantially the same format, under the\nheadline “[Named] Primary School closed as parents angered over last minute\nU-turn decision”.\n4. Links\nto the articles were posted on the publication’s Facebook and Twitter pages on\nthe same date as the article’s online publication. The text of the posts said\n“East Yorkshire Primary School shuts as parents angry over U-turn”, and they included\na quote from the article: “’I find it staggering how the school is choosing not\nto take government advice’”, while another said “A letter was sent out to\nparents”.\n5. The\ncomplainant said that the article and social media posts were inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1; the school was not, at the time of the article’s\npublication, planning to close. The complainant said that the email was\nintended merely to make parents at the school aware of the then-current\nposition of teaching Unions and the government, and how this may impact the\nschool in the future. He noted that the email quoted in the article confirmed\nthis, as it did not state that the school would be closing and instead made\nclear that “arrangements” were still being made and that the school was\n“await[ing] further developments from the Government and the Unions.”\n6. The\npublication said it accepted that the original article and headline were\ninaccurate, as the school had not told parents that it would be closing at the\ntime of the article’s publication. It said that a parent had contacted the\nnewspaper and informed it that the school would not be reopening, and had\npassed it a copy of the email; however, it was unable to provide a copy of the\nemail that the parent had forwarded to the publication, as the reporter had\ndeleted it from their inbox. It did, however, provide the original messages\nwhich passed between the parent and the newspaper. The publication had then\nattempted to contact the school to verify the information, but had not been\nable to make contact prior to the article’s publication. The next day, and\nafter the article’s publication, the headmaster of the school contacted the\npublication to make it aware of the true position, which was that the school\nwas intending to open the following day. \nThe publication noted that the school did not in fact open the following\nday, as government guidance came into force and mandated schools to remain\nclosed to a majority of pupils.\n7. After\nthe headmaster contacted the publication, it amended the online version of the\narticle and deleted the social media posts linking to the article. The amended\nheadline read “[Named] Primary School warns parents of serious disruption and\nhome learning if teachers stay away”. The amended article went on to report\nthat “[a] primary school has warned it faces serious disruption and potential\nclosure as a result of uncertainty whether teachers will follow calls to not go\nin because of fears over Covid infection. Parents at [Named] Primary School\nreceived an email from the headteacher on Sunday afternoon advising that pupils\nmay have to move to home learning when the school is due to reopen on Tuesday.\nThis is due to unions recommending that schools should not currently reopen due\nto the rising cases of coronavirus.” It also added a footnote to the amended\nversion of the article, which read as follows:\nThis\narticle was amended on January 4 to reflect the uncertainty whether the school\nwill reopen on Tuesday Jan 5. The article had originally stated that the school\nwould close upon the union's recommendation. In fact the school closed due to\nthe Government’s guidance. We are happy to clarify this.\nThe\npublication noted that the school had not expressed any dissatisfaction with\nthe corrective action undertaken by the publication.\n8. The\ncomplainant said that, regardless of the article’s later amendment, the\ninaccurate version had remained online for over 16 hours and had been shared\nnumerous times to the publication’s social media channels during this time. He\nalso noted that the print version of the article had not been corrected.\n9. The\npublication published a print clarification on page 8 of its print edition on 3\nFebruary 2021. The wording of the print clarification was, as follows:\nOur\narticle 'Parent's anger over last-minute U-turn decision to close school', 4\nJan 2021, reported that the headteacher of [Named] Primary School sent an email\nto parents advising that children should not go back into school on Tuesday 5th\nJanuary, due to union's recommendation. The headteacher has since advised that\nthe email did not state the school would be closed, but that it was warning the\nparents that some or part of the school may have to close. In fact, the school\ndid not open on the Tuesday due to Government guidance. We are happy to clarify\nthis.\n10. The\ncomplainant said that the action taken by the publication would not be\nsufficient to resolve his complaint, noting that no correction had appeared on\nsocial media and that he expected that any correction to be published on social\nmedia with the same prominence and repetition as the original article; he said\nthat several social media posts linking to the article had remained online for\n36 hours after he made his complaint to IPSO. The complainant had not been able\nto demonstrate that they had remained online for the period of time specified,\nas the social media links to the original inaccurate story had been deleted\nprior to IPSO making the newspaper aware that the article may raise a possible\nbreach of the Code. However, the complainant had provided screenshots of the\nposts in question, demonstrating they had been live at the time he had made his\ncomplaint.\n11. The\npublication said that it did not consider that it would be proportionate to\npublish a correction on its social media channels, where the social media posts\nlinking to the article had been removed as soon as it became aware of the\npotential confusion arising from the article.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A fair\nopportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n12.\nUnder the terms of Clause 1 (i), the newspaper was required to take care not to\npublish inaccurate, misleading, or distorted information. The original article\nreported that the school would not be reopening after the Christmas break\n“despite parents being urged by the government to send kids to school.” This\nwas inaccurate; at the time of the article’s publication the school was on\ncourse to reopen. The email quoted in full in the article made the true\nposition clear, which was that the school was – at the time of publication –\nawaiting further guidance, and was evaluating “if [it] had to close”. While the\nCommittee noted that a parent had informed the publication that the school was\nclosing – though it noted, with concern, that the original email from the parent\nto the publication had been deleted – and that the publication had approached\nthe school to verify the information in the article, where the email itself\nquoted in the article appeared to contradict the parent’s position, the\nCommittee found that the publication had not taken sufficient care not to\npublish inaccurate information. The publication had published a story\nannouncing the closure of a primary school, based only on unverified comments\nfrom a parent and despite being in possession of an email which contradicted\nthese comments. There was a clear breach of 1 (i).\n13. The\narticle was published during a period of great confusion regarding plans for\nin-person schooling, and reported information which was inaccurate and may have\nled to greater confusion amongst the local community. The inaccuracy was\ntherefore significant and required correction under the terms of Clause 1 (ii).\n14. The\nCommittee turned next to whether the action taken by the publication had been\nsufficient to avoid a further breach of Clause 1 (ii). For corrective action to\nsatisfy the terms of Clause 1 (ii), it must be published promptly and with due\nprominence. The corrective action should also make clear what information is\nbeing corrected, and what the true position is.\n15. The\nonline article was amended, and a footnote added to the article, on the same\nday it was published. The print article was corrected nearly a month after the\noriginal print article’s publication. Both the print clarification and the\nonline amendments and footnote made clear what was being clarified, and what\nthe true position was. They appeared with due prominence, with the print\narticle and clarification both appearing on the same page of their respective\neditions and the amended article replacing the original inaccurate article and\nthe footnote appearing at the bottom of the article. The Committee found that\nthe corrective actions undertaken by the publication both in print and online\nversions of the article were sufficient to meet the terms of Clause 1 (ii).\n16. The\nCommittee considered the social media posts, which had been live at the time\nthe complainant made his complaint to IPSO. Where text appears in a social\nmedia post, and that text constitutes a significant inaccuracy, any correction\nmust be issued on that same medium to meet the due prominence requirement of\nClause 1(ii). As such, to meet the terms of Clause 1 (ii), the newspaper was\nrequired to publish corrections on both its Facebook and Twitter accounts. It\nhad not done so, and there was a breach of Clause 1 (ii) in relation to the\nFacebook and Twitter posts.\nConclusions\n17. The\ncomplaint was upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n18.\nHaving partially upheld a breach of Clause 1, the Committee considered what\nremedial action should be required. In circumstances where the Committee\nestablishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the publication of a\ncorrection and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of which is\ndetermined by IPSO.\n19. The\nnewspaper had taken steps to correct the print and online articles in line with\nthe terms of Clause 1(ii); the breach of Clause 1 (ii) arose solely from social\nmedia posts made on Facebook and Twitter. As such, the Committee concluded that\nthe appropriate remedy was the publication of corrections on the publication’s\nFacebook and Twitter pages.\n20. The\nsocial media corrections should make clear the original inaccuracy, and set out\nthe correct position. They should be posted on the same Facebook and Twitter\naccounts as the original posts, and remain on the social media feeds for a\nperiod commensurate with the publication’s standard practices for editorial\ncontent. The wording of the corrections should make clear that they have been\npublished following an upheld correction from the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation.\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 01/04/2021\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 15/09/2021\n \nIndependent\nComplaints Reviewer\nThe\ncomplainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer about the process\nfollowed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent Reviewer found\nthat the IPSO process was flawed, as the Committee had not ruled on the complaint\nin relation to the social media posts, instead considering the complaint\nagainst the article alone. The complaint was therefore returned to the\nCommittee to consider the complaint in relation to the social media posts, and\nthe Committee issued an amended ruling.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
