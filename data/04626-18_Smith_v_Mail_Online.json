It said that a third man [the complainant] “was released on bail\npending an ongoing criminal probe along with a fourth Brit”. The complainant\nwas described as a “professional boxer”, and his full name, age and home town\nwere included. The article stated that “all four men are understood to strongly\ndeny the allegations”, and went on to describe how the conditions attached to\nthe release of the two men “have not been made clear”. The article also stated\nthat the two men who had been released had checked out of their holiday\napartment, and that it was “not immediately clear” if they had yet left Ibiza.\nA photograph of the complainant in his boxing kit was included in the article;\nits caption repeated information previously reported in the article, including\nhis name and home town. 3.   \nThe\ncomplainant said that the article breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) because he said\nit was not accurate to say he’d been released “on bail”: he said that, in fact,\nno conditions had been attached to his release, no charges had been laid\nagainst him, and he had been free to return to the UK. He provided an email\nfrom his solicitor in which they stated that they were requesting the “end of\nthe case” against him. 4.   \nThe\ncomplainant also said that the article breached Clause 2 (Privacy) because it\nhad included his image, name, home town and profession, despite the fact that\nthe case had been heard in a ‘closed’ preliminary court hearing in Spain. He\nsaid that the photograph had been taken from his social media account without\nconsent, and expressed concerns about the impact of the article on his career. 5.   \nThe\npublication denied any breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy). It said that its reporter\nhad been told, by a court official, that the complainant had been released\nafter questioning and given “libertad\nprovisional” - ‘provisional freedom’ – by the Spanish court. It said that\nin Spain the standard practice was to bring charges – or dismiss a case – once\nthe court investigation was complete; during the investigation period, the\naccused would be given “libertad\nprovisional”. The publication said that this status was akin to “bail” in\nthat it often required that a person report back to the court when requested to\ndo so by the judge; like bail, it was a form of conditional release,\nprovisional on the outcome of the investigation. It also said that the fact\nthat the complainant’s solicitor had been requesting the “end of the case”\nagainst him indicated that the investigation had been ongoing, and that it was\nnot the case that he had simply been released without any further action or\ninvestigation. Nevertheless, the publication offered to amend the article to\nstate that the complainant had been “freed\npending an ongoing criminal probe”, instead of “released on bail”. 6.   \nThe\npublication also denied any breach of Clause 2 (Privacy). It said that, while\nthe press had not been allowed to attend the hearing into the complainant’s\ncase, there had been no reporting restrictions or secrecy order in place. The\npublication argued that, while the ‘closed’ nature of the proceedings reflected\nthe standard practice in Spain for preliminary hearings, this local convention\ndid not prevent it from naming the complainant, as there was no legal restriction\non doing so. It said that irrespective of the local practice, there was no\nexpectation of privacy for an individual making a court appearance following an\narrest in relation to a serious crime. In addition, the publication said that\nthe photograph of the complainant had been taken from an open social media\naccount, where it was clearly used to promote his career and name, and that the\ncomplainant’s home town did not represent private information about him.\nNevertheless, the publication offered, as a gesture of goodwill, to remove the\nidentifying details relating to the complainant from the article. \nRelevant\nCode Provisions 7. Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The Press must take care not to\npublish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including\nheadlines not supported by the text. ii) A significant inaccuracy,\nmisleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due\nprominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In cases involving\nIPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator.  iii) A fair opportunity to reply to\nsignificant inaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for. \nClause 2 (Privacy)* i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or\nher private and family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. ii) Editors will be expected to justify\nintrusions into any individual's private life without consent. In considering\nan individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information and the extent to which the\nmaterial complained about is already in the public domain or will become so. iii) It is unacceptable to photograph\nindividuals, without their consent, in public or private places where there is\na reasonable expectation of privacy. \nFindings of the Committee \n8. The\npublication had been informed, by a court official, that the complainant had\nbeen given “provisional liberty”: he had been released while an investigation\nwas ongoing, with no charges against him. This appeared to be in line with the\nstandard legal process in Spain, and the complainant had not provided any\ngrounds for disputing that he had been given this status. Given that this\nstatus appeared to represent a conditional release pending an ongoing\ninvestigation, it was not misleading to refer to it as “bail”. There was no\nfailure to take care over this claim, and no misleading impression that\nrequired correction; consequently, there was no breach of Clause 1 on this\npoint. The Committee noted that the article made clear that the allegations\nwere denied; that the complainant had not been charged; and that he had been\nreleased after questioning.\n9. The\ncomplainant’s name had not been released by the court official, and the hearing\nhad taken place ‘behind closed doors’, in line with the standard Spanish\npractice. the complainant had not, however, provided any basis for considering\nthat there were any reporting restrictions in place, or that there were any\nlegal restrictions in relation to naming him. The article had reported the fact\nof the complainant’s arrest, his appearance in court, and his conditional\nrelease. This was not information about which he had a reasonable expectation\nof privacy.  Publishing this information\ndid not therefore represent a breach of Clause 2 (Privacy). The complainant’s\nphotograph had been publicly available on his social media profile, and\npublishing it did not therefore reveal any information not already in the public\ndomain; there was no breach of Clause 2 (Privacy) on this point. Finally, the\ncomplainant’s profession and home town were already in the public domain, and\ndid not represent private information about him; reporting this information was\nnot a breach of Clause 2. \nConclusions 10.  The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\naction required 11. N/A\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 22/07/2018\nDate\ndecision issued: 30/11/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
