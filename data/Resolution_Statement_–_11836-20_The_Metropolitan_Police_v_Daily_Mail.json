The Metropolitan Police complained to the Independent\nPress Standards Organisation that the Daily Mail breached Clause 1 (Accuracy)\nof the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Athlete in racism row\nlays blame at Met chief 's door”, published on 7 July 2020.2. The article reported on the detention of a British\nathlete. The subheadline said that the athlete had been subjected to an\n“arrest”.3. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1, as there had been no arrest.  4. The publication did not accept a breach of Clause 1, and\nsaid that there was no material difference between being arrested and being\ndetained under the PACE Act.Relevant Code Provisions5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Mediated Outcome6.

The publication offered to print the following\ncorrection:\"A headline on July 7 about [named athlete] being handcuffed\nby police referred to the incident as an ‘arrest’. In fact, she was not\narrested, but detained under stop and search legislation.\"8. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto his satisfaction.9. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code. Date complaint received: 10/07/2020\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 15/07/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
