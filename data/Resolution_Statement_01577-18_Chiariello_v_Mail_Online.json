Gez Chiariello\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Mail Online\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3 (Harassment) and\nClause 9 (Reporting of crime) in an article headlined “Married rape case\ndetective, 44, who says he is 'drugs expert' is arrested on suspicion of\ninciting prostitution and supplying medicines without a prescription”, published\non 12 February 2018.\n2. The article\nreported that a Detective Inspector based at Milton Keynes Police Station had\nbeen arrested on suspicion of inciting prostitution and supplying medicines\nwithout a prescription. The article identified the complainant as being the\nformer colleague of the Detective Inspector, and reported that the complainant\n“was sacked after being exposed as a liar and love cheat last year”; it also\ncontained his photograph.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that he had no relevance to the story. While he accepted that he had\nworked at the same police station as the Detective Inspector, he said that they\nhad worked in different department. The complainant said that in those\ncircumstances, the publication of information relating to him was misleading,\nintrusive and constituted harassment.\n4. The publication\ndid not accept that it had breached the Code. It said that the inclusion of the\ncomplainant’s details in the article was justified, given the rarity of two\nhigh profile police officers, working within the same station, both being\nsuspended from duty and also being arrested for alleged offences. It noted that\nthe complainant objected to the facts relating to his dismissal being included\nin the article, but said that this did not render the article inaccurate.\nRelevant Code provisions\n5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and – where\nappropriate- an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nClause 2 (Privacy) *\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual’s private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nClause 3. (Harassment)\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\nClause 9 (Reporting of Crime)\ni) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of\ncrime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they are\ngenuinely relevant to the story.\nii) Particular regard should be paid to the potentially\nvulnerable position of children under the age of 18 who witness, or are victims\nof, crime. This should not restrict the right to report legal proceedings.\nMediated outcome\n6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n7. Following IPSO’s\nintervention, the publication offered, as a gesture of good will, to remove all\nreferences to the complainant from the article.\n8. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to his satisfaction.\n9. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 14/02/2018Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 08/03/2018 \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
