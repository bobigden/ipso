Dean Purcell\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that thesun.co.uk\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “THUG'S SEX RAP: Violent thug must tell police every time he has sex\nwith new woman after battering ex”, published on 16 April 2018.2. The article\nreported that the complainant had been issued with a Criminal Behaviour Order,\nwhich ordered that for the next seven years he must, within three days of the\nthird time he has any sexual activity with a woman, give police her details so\nthey can speak to her. It said that in March 2018 the complainant had received\na custodial sentence after he had pleaded guilty to ABH and two counts of\nassault by beating against his former girlfriend. It also reported that\n“charges of false imprisonment, threats to kill, and a count of battery were\nleft to lie on file”.\n3. The article\nreported a series of events apparently leading up to the complainant’s\nconviction. The article reported that the complainant had been attending\ndomestic violence meetings after moving in with his former partner; it said\nthat the complainant started to “assault the victim, initially by name calling\nand slapping her, before becoming ‘extremely controlling’ of her”; it said that\non one occasion, an argument ended with the complainant “pulling [the victim’s]\nhair and biting her right ear”. The article reported that later that day the\ncomplainant “accused her of having sex with other men, before covering her\nmouth and nose with both his hands”.\n4. The article\nreported that “police say the next morning he threatened her with a knife,\nsaying he would kill her and himself unless she told him the truth. He only put\nthe knife down when she again reassured him.” The article reported that the\nvictim felt “unable to leave” because of the complainant’s behaviour. The\narticle said that “when a benefits welfare officer visited their flat, the\nvictim was too afraid of Purcell to say what had happened”. It said “when the\nvictim asked Purcell if she could take a bath to stay out the way, he took her\nphone from her”; “while Purcell was distracted by the benefits welfare office,\nthe victim climbed out the bathroom window in her dressing gown, ran to their\nlocal shop and asked someone to call the police”.\n5. The complainant\nsaid that the article had created an inaccurate and misleading impression of\nthe conduct to which he had pleaded guilty. He said that the article had\npresented the allegations about his conduct which the victim had made against\nhim, as though they had been accepted by him as the basis for his guilty plea.\n6. The complainant\nsaid that the article had been based on an inaccurate police press release,\nwhich was subject to complaint. He said that this press release had presented\nthe allegations made about his conduct as having been established by the court\nas fact; he said that only the facts which he had accepted as part of his basis\nof plea, and which had been referred to in his plea hearing, should have been\nreported on.7. The complainant provided a copy of his Basis\nof Plea. It recorded that the complainant had pleaded guilty to an ABH charge\non the basis of excessive self defence: “The defendant felt it necessary to\nrestrain the complainant. This involved holding her on the bed with his body\nweight and holding his hand over her mouth in an apparent attempt to prevent\nher making noise”.\n8. During the\ncourse of IPSO’s investigation, the complainant received the outcome of his\ncomplaint with the police’s press release. The police confirmed that its press\nrelease “contained information that had been alleged by the victim, but not\naccepted by the defendant as a basis for his plea of guilty. His plea was on\nthe basis of excessive self-defence which was accepted by the prosecution”. The\npolice invited publications to remove reference to incidents not included in\nthe Basis of Plea.\n9. The complainant\nalso provided a transcript of his plea hearing. This recorded that the two\ncounts of assault related to an incident where the victim’s hair was pulled,\nand one incident where the victim had received “a punch to the leg while they\nwere in [the complainant’s] car”.\n10. The publication did not accept that it had breached the\nCode. It said that it was entitled to rely upon the contents of a police press\nrelease; it was not a failure to take care over the accuracy of the article to\ndo so. The publication offered to amend the article to clarify that the events\nwhich were set out in the article, but which were not accepted as part of the\ncomplainant’s basis of plea, were allegations heard in court.\n11. The publication also offered to add the following\nfootnote online:\nA previous version of this article, which was based on\ninformation released by the Met Police, said that Mr Purcell had called the\ncomplainant names, slapped her, became \"extremely controlling\" of her\nand bit her right ear. It has now been amended to make clear that, while those\nallegations were heard in court, they did not form part of Mr Purcell's basis\nof plea. The article has also been amended to note that when Mr Purcell was\npinning his victim to the bed, he covered her mouth and nose with one hand, not\ntwo.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n12. It was not a failure to take care over the accuracy of\nthe article, to rely on the contents of a police press release which had been\nissued following the complainant’s conviction. The publication was entitled to\nrely on the accuracy of information from this official source. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1(i).\n13. The article had accurately recorded what had been heard\nduring court proceedings; however it had failed to distinguish between the\nallegations which were accepted by the complainant as part of his guilty plea,\nand the allegations which were not. It reported, as fact that the complainant\nhad name-called the victim; slapped her; bit her right ear, and threatened her\nwith a knife. These were not incidents which had been accepted by the\ncomplainant in his basis of plea. Accordingly, the article had given a significantly\nmisleading impression of the nature and extent of the conduct which had formed\nthe basis for his conviction. The footnote offered by the publication made\nclear the correct position. It was offered sufficiently promptly, upon receipt\nof the outcome of the complainant’s complaint against the police press release\nand the court transcript provided by the complainant. In conjunction with the\noffer to amend the article, publication of this wording as a footnote to the\narticle represented due prominence. There was no breach of Clause 1 (ii). In\norder to avoid a breach of Clause 1 (ii), the publication should now amend its\narticle as offered, and add the clarification as a footnote.\nConclusions\n15. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial action required\n16. N/A\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer\nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
