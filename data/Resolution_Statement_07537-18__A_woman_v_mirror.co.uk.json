It said that prior to her death, the woman had faced prosecution for allegedly assaulting an animal rights campaigner. A number of photographs, apparently showing the woman who died, accompanied the article.3. The complainant was a friend of the woman who died. She said that a photograph of her had been published in the article; she had therefore been identified in error as the woman who had been accused of assault, and who had subsequently died.4. The publication accepted that they had included a photograph of the complainant, in error, and removed it from online article. The newspaper sought to resolve the matter through mediation.Relevant Code Provisions5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the text.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator.iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Mediated outcome6. The complaint was not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter.7. During IPSO’s investigation, a private agreement was reached between the parties, which resolved the matter to the complainant’s satisfaction.8. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code. Date complaint received: 27/11/2018Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 23/04/2019\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
