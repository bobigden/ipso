Fiona\nThomson-Tur complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The\nOxford Times breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in\nan article headlined, “Scuba Horror: Dream holiday becomes a nightmare as man\ndrowns while diving,” published on 4 October 2018.2. The article was\na report of an inquest into the death of the complainant’s husband. It reported\nthat he had died while diving in the Seychelles. It said that he had got into\ndifficulties when his new mask “sprang a leak”, and had joked to his wife that\nhe had experienced a similar problem on a previous holiday. The article\nreported that the complainant had seen her husband “thrashing about and\nrealised he was in serious trouble” and said that he had been found floating\nface up in the water.3. The complainant\nsaid that the article was an inaccurate account of what had been said at the\ninquest. She said that her husband had been snorkelling, not diving, and that\nthe leak in his mask had not happened before, and was not linked to his death.\nShe also said she had not been aware of her husband struggling in the water,\nand said that he had been floating face down.4. The publication\nsaid that the article had been provided by a reputable news agency. It accepted\nthat the reference in the headline to scuba diving was inaccurate, and changed\nthis as soon as it received the complaint. It said that the rest of the article\nwas an accurate report of what had been heard at the inquest.Relevant Code Provisions5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)i.

In cases involving IPSO, due\nprominence should be as required by the regulator.Mediated outcome6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties, IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.7. During IPSO’s\ninvestigation, the publication offered to remove the article.8. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to her satisfaction.9. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 07/10/2018\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 21/12/2018\n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
