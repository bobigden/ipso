    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision of the Complaints Committee 00223-14 Ritchie v Daily Record\nSummary of complaint\n1.  Mr Derek Ritchie\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Daily\nRecord had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Independence referendum: Yes campaigners protest outside BBC\nScotland HQ over political editor Nick Robinson’s ‘biased’ coverage”, published\nonline on 15 September 2014. \n2. The complainant considered that the reference to “furious\nprotesters”; the claim that those present had “laid siege to the BBC”; and the\nassertion that “a police cordon was thrown around the building” had given the\ninaccurate impression that a protest reported in the article had been\naggressive and threatening, and that police had to separate protesters from the\nBBC building. He had been present at the protest, which had taken place on 14\nSeptember 2014, and stated that it had been peaceful. No attempts had been made\nto enter the building. \n3. The newspaper said that there had been anger and\nfrustration in the crowd, directed at the BBC, and cited banners held by\nprotesters with slogans such as “Sack Nick ‘the liar’ Robinson. A totally\ncorrupt journalist. These days typical of the British Biased Corporation”, and\nchants of “BBC, shame on you”. There had been a significant police presence at\nthe event, and it provided photographs showing a police cordon formed to\nprevent protesters entering the building. The article had not suggested that\nthe crowd had been aggressive or threatening. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n4. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \nFindings of the Committee\n5. The complainant had not disputed that the protesters had\nbeen angry about the way in which the BBC had chosen to cover the referendum on\nScottish independence. Nor did he deny that protesters had displayed the\nplacards referred to in the article. While the complainant did not consider the\nnumber of police offers at the protest to represent a “significant presence”,\nthis was a matter of opinion. In the context of an article reporting that a protest\nhad taken place, and including comment from those present, the assertions to\nwhich the complainant objected did not render the piece significantly\nmisleading. \nConclusions\n6. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A\nDate of complaint: 17/09/2014\nDate decision issued: 15/12/2014\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
