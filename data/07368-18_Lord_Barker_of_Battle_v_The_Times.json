Lord Barker of\nBattle complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The\nTimes breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in the\nfollowing articles:“Tory peers\ntold to come clean about Russian links” published on 24 October 2018.“Calls grow\nfor foreign powers law to limit Russian influence” published on 25 October\n2018.\n2. The first\narticle formed part of the newspaper’s coverage of parliamentary concerns\nregarding the links between a number of peers and Russian companies. It\nreported on recent correspondence between the security minister and the Commons\nForeign Affairs Committee. It stated that a letter from the security minister\nto the Committee disclosed that the minister had been contacted by two\nConservative peers, including the complainant, “requesting government\nassistance for Russian associates”. It stated that the minister had declined\nthe offer to meet with the complainant, the chairman of a Russian energy\ncompany, to discuss sanctions. It said that these disclosures came “amid\nconcerns… that members of the Lords are seeking to lobby on behalf of Russian\ncompanies.” It also included a statement from the complainant, stating, “’I\nhave never lobbied the UK government or requested assistance from any member of\neither of the Houses of Parliament.’”\n3. The first\narticle was also published online with the same headline as the print article.\nIt included a photograph of the complainant, but was otherwise substantially\nthe same as the print article.\n4. The second\narticle reported that there were cross-party calls for a “foreign powers act”,\ndue to the financial interests a number of senior peers had in Russia. It\nreferred to the previous article, and repeated the claim that the complainant\nand another named peer with business links to Moscow had “requested government\nassistance for Russian associates”. It also included the complainant’s rebuttal\nof these allegations, stating that he “denied that he has requested assistance\nfrom the government on behalf of a Russian associate.”\n5. This article was\nalso published online with the same headline as the print article. It was\nsubstantially the same as the article that appeared in print.\n6. The complainant\nsaid that he had not requested government assistance for Russian associates,\nand provided a copy of the letter he had sent to the security minister, which\nhad also been provided to the newspaper prior to publication. The letter said that\nthe complainant was “actively pursuing a number of radical changes” in response\nto the U.S. sanctions that had been imposed on the energy company he was\ninvolved with, and would like to share this with the minister. It stated that\nthe complainant had “no ask of [the minister] or any Parliamentary colleagues”,\nwhich the complainant said made clear he was not seeking to lobby the\ngovernment for support on this matter. He also said that publishing his\nphotograph in the online version of the first article was misleading, as it\nsuggested he had to “come clean” about his Russian links, suggesting\nwrongdoing.\n7. The\ncomplainant also said that the articles had misrepresented the correspondence\nbetween the security minister and the Foreign Affairs Committee. The\ncomplainant provided this correspondence, in which the minister was asked if he\nhad “had any contact from Members of either House of Parliament requesting\ngovernment assistance from Russian associates…” The minister responded stating,\n“You asked if I have had any contact from Members of either House of Parliament\nrequesting Government assistance for Russian associates… I had a meeting with\n[named peer] at his request who wished to discuss his experiences working for\n[a named company]. I was also asked by Lord Barker of Battle to meet to discuss\nsanctions. I did not take up his offer.” The complainant said that the minister\nhad not described his letter as a request for assistance, but stated he had\nasked to meet to discuss sanctions. Therefore he believed the newspaper’s basis\nfor alleging he had requested government assistance in this matter, was\ninaccurate.\n8. The newspaper\ndid not accept that it had breached the Code. It said that the articles had not\nreported as fact that the complainant had sought to lobby the government, but\nhad clearly presented this as minister’s characterisation of the complainant’s\naction, which it was entitled to report. It said it had not misrepresented the\nexchange of correspondence between the minister and the committee, and that\nwhere the minister had adopted the phrase “requested government assistance for\nRussian associates” in his response, and had gone on to refer to the\ncomplainant’s offer of a meeting in this context, the articles were accurate.\nFurther, it said that the articles included the complainant’s denial, and did\nnot accept that the photograph in the online version of the first article was\nmisleading in the way the complainant had suggested.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n9. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and – where\nappropriate – an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nFindings of the Committee\n10. The articles reported on the exchange of correspondence\nbetween the security minister and the Foreign Affairs Committee. The\ncorrespondence showed that the minister had been asked to give details of any\nparliamentarian who had contacted him “requesting Government assistance for\nRussian associates” during his time in office. Responding to this question, the\nminister specifically referred to the complainant, and the meeting he had\nrequested. The first article made clear that this exchange of correspondence\nwas what it was relying on, and it was quoted directly in the body of the\narticle. The first article also included the complainant’s denial, making clear\nthat he disputed the suggestion that his actions could be characterised as an\nattempt to lobby the government. In these circumstances, the newspaper had\ntaken care over the presentation of these claims in the first article, and\nthere was no failure to take care in breach of Clause 1(i). Also, where the\nbasis for the claims was made clear, and the complainant’s denial included, the\narticle was not inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (ii).\n11. The headline of the first article encompassed a number\nof separate concerns that had been raised in relation to the links between a\nnumber of peers and Russian companies, and the potential conflicts this may\ncreate. The article contained details of a number of different allegations that\nhad been made against various parliamentarians, some of which included\nallegations that some peers had not fully declared their links to Russian\ncompanies. However, the article made explicitly clear the nature of the allegation\nmade against the complainant, namely, that he had allegedly attempted to lobby\na government minister. In this context, the inclusion of his photograph beneath\nthis headline did not give a misleading impression of the extent of the claims\nmade against him. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n12. The second article made clear that the allegation\nagainst the complainant was that he had “requested government assistance for\nRussian associates” from the security minister. This reflected the language\nused by both the Commons Committee and the minister in his response. The\narticle also included the complainant’s denial that he had requested assistance\nfrom the government on this matter. Where the allegations were accurately\nreported, as was the complainant’s denial, there was no failure to take care,\nand no breach of Clause 1 (ii).\nConclusions\n13. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n14.
