Daniel Zajac\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nthesundaytimes.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Football hooligans join far-right ‘thugs’ to\nattack police over Black Lives Matter demos”, published on 13 June 2020. 2. The article\nreported on violence amidst the Black Lives Matter protests. It also referred\nto the statue of Winston Churchill outside the House of Commons, and reported\nthat the box which had been erected in order to protect the statue had been\ngraffitied with the wording: “Do not open, racist inside”.3. The complainant\nsaid that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) because\nthere was no graffiti on the box surrounding the statue. The complainant said\nthat there was an image that showed this phrase on the box which had circulated\non social media, however this was clearly fake.4. The publication\nsaid it accepted that the graffiti had been faked. It said that once it was\nmade aware of the error, it deleted the article.Relevant Clause Provisions5.

In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Mediated Outcome6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.7. The publication\noffered to publish the following correction on its online corrections page:On the Saturday July 4, Times Online briefly published a\nphotograph of graffiti on the hoarding around Churchill’s statue in Parliament\nSquare before being informed that it had been photoshopped. We apologise for\nthe mistake.8. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to his satisfaction.9. As the\ncomplaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 14/06/2020\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 10/08/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
