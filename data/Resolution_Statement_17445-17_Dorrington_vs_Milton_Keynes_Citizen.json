Darren\nDorrington complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the\nMilton Keynes Citizen breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Radio boss defends his suspended cop friend”,\npublished on 6 July 2017. 2. The article\nreported that a local police superintendent had been invited to attend a\ncommunity event at a mosque, while he was suspended from service. Following\nthis, it said that the local radio station had reported that the police chief\nwas facing a gross misconduct charge for his attendance at the event and had\nasked if the police were conducting a “witch hunt” against him.3. The article also\nreported that the complainant, who is the managing director of the radio\nstation, had “consistently defended” the suspended police chief.4. The complainant\ndenied that he had personally defended the suspended police superintendent,\nconsistently or otherwise. He also said that neither he nor the radio station\nhad asked whether the police were conducting a “witch hunt”: this was a\nquestion which had been asked by a member of the mosque and which had been\nfeatured in an article published by the radio station, which had reported on\nthe community event.5. The newspaper\nsaid that the complainant had promoted and defended the suspended police chief\nthrough the radio station, as a consequence of his senior position within it.\nIt said that because the article published by the radio station had not\nidentified the member of the mosque who had made the “witch hunt” comment, it\nattributed this quote to the radio station.Relevant Code provisionsClause 1 (Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.iii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.iv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.Mediated outcome6. The complaint was not resolved through direct correspondence\nbetween the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter.7. Following IPSO’s intervention, the newspaper offered to\nmeet with the complainant to discuss the issues raised in the complaint.8. The complainant said that the meeting with the newspaper\nhad been productive and beneficial and said that it had resolved the matter to\nhis satisfaction.\n9. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.Date complaint resolved: 09/08/2017Date complaint concluded by IPSO: 20/10/2017  \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
