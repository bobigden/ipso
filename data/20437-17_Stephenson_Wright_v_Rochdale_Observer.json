John Stephenson\nWright complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the\nRochdale Observer breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice\nin an article headlined, “Rapist to stay in jail longer for ‘wasting judge’s\ntime” published on 24 June 2017.\n2. The article\nreported that the complainant had unsuccessfully appealed against the sentence\nhe had received in 2012 for a number of sexual offences against children. The\nfirst paragraph of the article stated that the complainant had raped an\nunderage boy, who later became a police officer, and had abused two\nothers.  It stated that he had been\njailed for 18 years in 2012 and went on to report that the complainant had been\nsentenced to a further 18 months in 2017 for the crimes he had committed\nagainst the individual who went on to become a police officer. The article\nreported that the complainant had been found guilty of three counts of rape, 21\ncounts of indecent assault, one count of indecency with a child and one count\nof perverting the course of justice in 2012. It also included statements from\nthe man who was now a police officer, who had waived his right to anonymity.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that the article was inaccurate as his convictions for rape related to\nanother individual. He said that in relation to the individual who had gone on\nto become a police officer, he had been found guilty of sexual abuse not rape.\n4. The newspaper\nsaid that in 2012 the complainant had been convicted of three counts of rape of\na child and a number of other offences for the sexual abuse of two children. In\n2017 he had also been found guilty of sexual abuse against the individual named\nin the article, and in light of the seriousness of the complainant’s\nconvictions, it did not believe that reporting he had been found guilty of\nraping this individual, when in fact he had sexually abused him and raped\nanother, represented a significant inaccuracy. It said that a member of\neditorial staff had assumed that the individual who had waived his right to\nanonymity had been the individual who had been raped. Regardless, once it was\nmade aware of the correct position, the newspaper offered to publish the\nfollowing correction:\nIn a previous article headlined “Rapist to stay in jail\nlonger for ‘wasting judge’s time” of 24th June 2017 , we reported that John\nStephenson-Wright was sentenced to a further 18 months for crimes he committed\nagainst a boy who went on to become a police officer. We would like to make\nclear that this particular charge was not for rape but sexual abuse. Mr\nStephenson Wright denied the offence but was found guilty after a trial at\nManchester’s Minshull Street Crown Court.\nRelevant Code provisions\nClause 1(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and – where\nappropriate- an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nFindings of the Committee\n6. The Committee\nacknowledged that due to the anonymity granted by law to individuals in such\ncases, the court proceedings would not have identified which convictions related\nto which individual. However, the newspaper had not taken any steps to verify\nwhich of the convictions related to the individual who had waived his right to\nanonymity and who had discussed the effect the abuse had on him. In\ncircumstances where the newspaper was aware that there were a number of victims\ninvolved in the case, and that the complainant had been convicted of a range of\nsexual offences, presuming that he had been convicted for raping the victim who\nhad waived his right to anonymity, without taking any steps to verify this,\nrepresented a failure to take care in breach of Clause 1(i).\n7. The Committee\nnoted that the article had accurately reported the offences for which the\ncomplainant had been convicted in 2012 and his subsequent convictions in 2017.\nHowever, as this was a report of court proceedings, inaccurately reporting the\noffence for which the complainant had been convicted in relation to the named\nindividual represented a significant inaccuracy, that required correction under\nthe terms of Clause 1 (ii). The newspaper had promptly offered to publish a\ncorrection, which identified the inaccuracy and made the correct position\nclear. This was sufficient to avoid a breach of Clause 1 (ii) and should now be\npublished.\nConclusions\n8. The complaint\nwas upheld\nRemedial Action Required\n9. Having upheld\nthe complaint, the Committee considered what remedial action should be\nrequired.\n10. The Committee considered that the newspaper had promptly\noffered to publish a correction which addressed the significant inaccuracy and\nmade the correct position clear. This should now be published.\nDate complaint received: 19/10/2017Date decision issued: 26/03/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
