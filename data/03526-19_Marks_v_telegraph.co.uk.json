David Marks\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that telegraph.co.uk\nbreached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 3 (Harassment) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Parked car belonging to imprisoned man cannot\nbe moved because of his blue badge, council says”, published on 13 June 2018.\n2. The article\nreported that the complainant’s car had allegedly been left in a parking space\noutside a court house for several months. The article said that the complainant\nhad “reportedly” left the car there after being unable to return to it, because\nhe had received a custodial sentence for “racially or religiously aggravated\nharassment”.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that the article was inaccurate, in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy), because\nhe had not received a custodial sentence for racially or religiously aggravated\nharassment. He explained that he had been convicted of breaching a restraining\norder and a bomb hoax, although he acknowledged that he had received a previous\nconviction for racially or religiously aggravated harassment. The complainant\nalso said that the publication of the article was a form of harassment, and\nalleged that the publication was complicit in continued harassment which he had\nbeen experiencing from members of the public. \n4. The publication\ndid not accept a breach of the Code.  It\nsaid that it took care to report the complainant’s conviction, as set out in a\nlocal newspaper, accurately, and clearly presented this as such. Upon receipt\nof the documentation provided by the complainant, which showed that he had\nreceived a custodial sentence for breaching a restraining order and a bomb\nhoax, the publication acknowledged the error. In an attempt to resolve the\ncomplaint, the publication amended the article accordingly, and published the\nfollowing footnote clarification:\nCORRECTION: This article previously reported that David\nMarks was convicted of \"racial or religiously aggravated harassment\".\nHe was in fact sentenced to imprisonment for making a bomb hoax and breach of a\nrestraining order. We are happy to clarify.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nClause 3 (Harassment)*\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\nFindings of the Committee\n5. The publication\nhad taken care to report the details of the complainant’s conviction, as set\nout in an article published in a local publication, accurately; it was not in\ndispute that the complainant had previously been convicted of racially or\nreligiously aggravated harassment. Further, the article was not a report of the\ncomplainant’s trial or sentencing; the reference to the complainant’s\nconviction was made in the context of an article which focused on the\ncomplainant allegedly leaving his car outside of court. In all the\ncircumstances, the Committee established that the reference to the\ncomplainant's earlier conviction, albeit inaccurate in this context, did not,\nas a whole, give a misleading impression of the offences to which the\ncomplainant had been found guilty; the error did not require correction under\nthe terms of Clause 1(ii). Nevertheless, the Committee welcomed the publication’s\ndecision to add a footnote clarification.6. The complainant\nhad not provided any basis to show that journalists acting on behalf of the\npublication had engaged in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit. The\npublication of the article in of itself was not a matter which engaged the terms\nof Clause 3. There was no breach of the Code.\nConclusions\n7. The complaint\nwas not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n8. N/A\nDate complaint received: 18/04/2019\nDate decision issued: 27/06/2019\nReview\nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
