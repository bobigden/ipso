Adam Lynch complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that Metro.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors' Code\nof Practice in publishing article headlined “How to watch The Mandalorian in\nthe UK\" published on 12 November 2019.\n2. The complainant said that the article’s headline was not\nsupported by the text as it implied that The Mandalorian (a TV show) could\ncurrently be watched in the UK. Instead, the text of the article states that UK\nviewers will have to wait until March 2020 to watch the show.\n3. The publication did not accept that they had breached the\nCode. It stated that the headline did not imply that the show could currently\nbe watched in the UK. Instead, the publication stated that the text clarified\nthe headline and accurately detailed how to watch the show in the UK, albeit\nthat this means waiting until March 2020.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n4. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n5. During IPSO’s investigation, as a gesture of goodwill,\nthe newspaper offered to publish an amended headline which stated:\n“Mandelorian set for UK release in March 2020 – here’s how\nto watch it”.\n6. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto his satisfaction.\n7. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 12/11/2019\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 14/01/2020\n \n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
