It reported the sequence of events leading up to his death, and the\nconclusions of the coroner. The article was also published online. 3.   \nThe\ncomplainant said that the article, including the headline, had inaccurately reported\nthe series of events that had occurred prior to her husband’s death. She said\nthis did not reflect what had been heard at the inquest, and provided a\nstatement from the coroner who confirmed her findings.  She said that inaccurately reporting the\ncircumstances around her husband’s death had intruded into her grief and shock. 4.   \nThe\nnewspaper expressed its sympathies for the complainant’s loss and apologised\nfor any distress caused. It said that its reporters always attempt to speak to\nfamily members at inquests to make them aware that the newspaper will cover the\nstory and ask if the family wish to pay a personal tribute. It said as the\ncomplainant had not attended the inquest, it was unable to do so on this\noccasion, but offered to publish a tribute piece if the complainant wished. It\nsaid that it had revisited the reporter’s shorthand notes and believed that the\narticle accurately reflected what had been heard at the inquest.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions 5.   \nClause\n1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not\nto publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including\nheadlines not supported by the text. \nii) A significant inaccuracy,\nmisleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due\nprominence, and – where appropriate- an apology published. In cases involving\nIPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator. \nClause 4 (Intrusion into grief or\nshock) \nIn cases involving personal grief\nor shock, enquiries and approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion\nand publication handled sensitively. These provisions should not restrict the\nright to report legal proceedings. \nMediated\nOutcome 6.   \nThe\ncomplaint was not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties.\nIPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter. 7.   \nDuring\nIPSO’s investigation, the newspaper apologised for the distress and upset\ncaused by the article. It offered to remove the online article and to write a\nprivate letter of apology to the complainant. 8.   \nThe\ncomplainant said that this would resolve the matter to her satisfaction. 9.   \nAs\nthe complaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make\na determination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code. \nDate\ncomplaint received: 11/04/2018\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 05/06/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
