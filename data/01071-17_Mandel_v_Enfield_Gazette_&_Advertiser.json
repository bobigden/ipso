Paul Mandel\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Enfield\nGazette and Advertiser breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Stop them!”, published on 25 January 2017.\nThe article was also published online with the headline “Enfield’s ‘Fast and\nFurious’- style boy racers putting lives at risk”.\n2. The article\nreported that following a two car crash, residents of Enfield were “demanding\nurgent action by police to stop illegal high-speed ‘Fast and Furious’-style car\nraces”. The article reported that committee members from a Resident’\nAssociation helped police carry out checks with laser guns which record\ndrivers’ speed. It reported that a spokesperson for the association, the\ncomplainant, had said:  “It’s a not a new\nproblem. We go out and help people with laser guns. It records their speeds –\nsome of them are unbelievable – but it’s not any good really, there’s no\nenforcement, it just acts as a warning”.\n3. The online article\nwas the same as the print version of the article.\n4. The complainant\nsaid that he had not made the comments reported in the article, and it was\ntherefore inaccurate. He said that he had read out a prepared statement to the\njournalist he had spoken to prior to publication. In addition to reading this\nstatement, he had said that drivers get a more strongly worded warning each\ntime they are caught speeding, and that on the third occasion, the car’s\nregistration number is added to a police database. He said he also commented\nthat a certain gathering of youths in cars had recommenced, after having been\nstopped by police for a while.  The\ncomplainant denied having said that the speed-checks were “not any good really”.\nHe said that neither he, nor the Residents Association, would participate in\nthe speed-checks if they held this view, although he had called for more\nenforcement. In relation to the comment that “there’s no enforcement, it just\nacts as a warning”, the complainant said could not recall ever saying precisely\nthis. The complainant suggested that the newspaper may have misattributed to\nhim comments which were in fact made by another individual quoted in the\narticle.\n5. The newspaper\nprovided a copy of the shorthand notes made by its reporter during her\ntelephone conversation with the complainant, and provided a transcript of these\nnotes. It said that the shorthand notes recorded that the complainant had said\nthat “a couple of residents and community support officers help catch people with\nlaser guns. It records speeds of over 30 mph. But it's not any good really –\n36mph or over get letters. The drivers get a warning letter. At the end of the\nday there's no enforcement, it acts as a warning”.  The newspaper denied that it had\nmisattributed the comments from the other individual quoted in the article; it\nsaid that there was a clear break in the short hand notes between the\njournalist’s conversation with the complainant, and the other individual quoted\nin the article under complaint.\nRelevant Code provisions\n6. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n7. The complainant\nhad spoken to the newspaper’s journalist prior to publication. The journalist\nhad taken detailed short hand notes of this conversation, in which the\nbeginning of her conversation with the complainant was clearly marked. The\nCommittee noted that these notes recorded comments it was agreed the\ncomplainant had made in relation to drivers receiving warning letters after\nbeing caught speeding, and in relation to gatherings of youths in cars. The\nnewspaper had demonstrated it had taken care to publish an accurate account of\nthe complainant’s remarks, and there was no breach of Clause 1 (i).\n8. The complainant\ndisputed having referred to the residents’ collaboration with the police in\nusing laser guns as “not any good really”. He also said he could not recall\nsaying precisely: “there is no enforcement. It just acts as a warning”,\nalthough it was not in dispute that the complainant had expressed his\ndissatisfaction with the current level of enforcement. In response to the\ncomplaint, the newspaper provided its shorthand notes, along with a\ntranscription. These notes contained the words “but it’s not any good really”,\n“no enforcement”, and “warning”. The Committee was not in the position to\ndetermine whether the complainant had made these remarks. However, in\ncircumstances where the newspaper had provided notes which appeared to contain\nthe principal elements of the disputed comments, the Committee did not\ndetermine that the article inaccurately reported the complainant’s comments,\nsuch as to require correction under the terms of Clause 1 (ii).\nConclusions\n9. The complaint\nwas not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n10. N/A\nDate complaint received: 09/02/2017Date decision issued: 20/04/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
