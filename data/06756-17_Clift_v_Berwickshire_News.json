Each profile contained an image of\nthe candidate, alongside a short piece which had been written by them, which\ndetailed their policies and previous experience. \n3.  The article\nreported that “all candidates were given the opportunity to convince you they\ndeserve your vote and 11 of the 13 took up that opportunity”. The article did\nnot contain a profile from the complainant, and it said that “Michael Clift\nfrom Cockburnspath is standing as an independent in the East Berwickshire\nward”. \n4. The complainant said that the newspaper had made no\nattempt to contact him. Therefore he said that it was inaccurate for the\narticle to report that he had been given an opportunity to submit his profile\nfor publication. He further said that the article had inaccurately reported\nthat he was from Cockburnpath, when in fact he was from Coldingham. \n5. The newspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. It\nprovided a copy of an earlier print article, dated 6 April, which had also\nreported on the upcoming Council election, and which had stated: “Candidates\nare invited to send details for a profile ahead of May 4’s election”.  It said that when the complainant did not\nrespond to this, the newspaper had made a further attempt to contact him via\nFacebook messenger; the newspaper provided a screenshot of the message which\nwas sent to the complainant on 19 April, which invited him to submit his\nprofile for publication. \n6.  The newspaper\nnoted that the complainant was from Cockburnspath, rather than Coldingham, and\npublished a correction on this point, which stated: \nIn last week’s Berwickshire news, we said that Michael\nClift, an East Berwickshire ward candidate is from Cockburnspath, but he\nactually lives in Coldingham. We apologise for the error. \n7.  The complainant\nsaid that he had not seen the 6 April article, nor had he received the message\nwhich the newspaper had sent him over Facebook messenger, although he accepted\nthat the screenshot provided by the newspaper had shown that the newspaper had\nmade an attempt to contact him directly. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n8. Clause 1\n(Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant\ninaccuracies should be given, when reasonably called for. \niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign,\nmust distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nClause 12 (Discrimination)\ni) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative\nreference to an individual's, race, colour, religion, sex, gender identity,\nsexual orientation or to any physical or mental illness or disability. \nii) Details of an individual's race, colour, religion,\ngender identity, sexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability\nmust be avoided unless genuinely relevant to the story. \nFindings of the Committee \n9. The newspaper had published an earlier article, which\ncontained an open request to all candidates to submit a profile for\npublication, and it had also sent a direct message to the complainant on\nFacebook. While the Committee noted the complainant’s position that he had not\nbeen aware of the attempts made by the newspaper to contact him, it was not\ninaccurate for the article to report that he had not taken up an opportunity to\nsubmit a candidate profile for publication. The Committee did not consider that\nany inaccuracy relating to where the complainant lived, was significant, in\ncircumstances where the article had made clear which Council ward the\ncomplainant was contesting. The Committee also acknowledged that the newspaper\nhad published a prominent correction, promptly, in order to address this point.\nThere was no breach of Clause 1. \n10. Clause 12 protects identified individuals mentioned\nby the press against discrimination on the basis of their race, colour,\nreligion, gender, sexual orientation or any physical or mental illness or\ndisability. The complaint did not engage the terms of this Clause. \nConclusion \nThe complaint was not upheld \nRemedial Action Required \nN/A\nDate complaint received: 06/05/2017\nDate decision issued: 26/06/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
