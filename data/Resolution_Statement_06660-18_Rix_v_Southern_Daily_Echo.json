Simone Rix\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Southern\nDaily Echo breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 10\n(Clandestine devices and subterfuge) and Clause 14 (Confidential sources) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined: “PHOTOS: Large vehicle\ncarrier gets stuck on Millbrook Roundabout after 'not following diversion'”\npublished on 5 October 2018.\n2. The article\nreported on a large vehicle carrier which had become stuck after reportedly\nfailing to follow a diversion. The article reported a statement from a\nspokesperson of a company which had provided assistance to the vehicle during\ntransportation: “It [the lorry] got stuck because the transport company routed\nit that way. We were following the truck. We have been told it will be moved at\n8pm tonight.”\n3. The complainant,\nwho was the individual quoted in the article, said that she had received a\ntelephone call from someone who had claimed they were from the local dockyard;\nit was only after reading the article under complaint did she realise that she\nhad spoken to a journalist. The complainant said that she had been misled and\nmisquoted; she had made clear that the vehicle was not stuck, and would be\nmoved later in the day.\n4. The publication did not accept that there had\nbeen any breach of the Editors’ Code, and denied that any of its reporters\nwould deliberately mislead anyone in pursuit of a story. The publication said\nthat the journalist had taken care to retain a shorthand note of the\ncomplainant’s comments, which were reported accurately in the article.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.\nClause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge)\ni) The press must not seek to obtain or publish material\nacquired by using hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices; or by\nintercepting private or mobile telephone calls, messages or emails; or by the\nunauthorised removal of documents or photographs; or by accessing\ndigitally-held information without consent.\nii) Engaging in misrepresentation or subterfuge, including\nby agents or intermediaries, can generally be justified only in the public\ninterest and then only when the material cannot be obtained by other means.\n14. Confidential sources\nJournalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential\nsources of information.\nMediated outcome\n6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter\n7.  During IPSO’s\ninvestigation the publication offered to remove the comment which was the\nsubject of complaint, as a gesture of goodwill.\n8. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the complaint to her satisfaction.\n9. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 08/10/2018\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 18/10/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
