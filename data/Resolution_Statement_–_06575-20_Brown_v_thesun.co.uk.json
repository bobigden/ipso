Kerry Brown complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that thesun.co.uk breached Clause1 (Accuracy) of the Editors' Code\nof Practice in an article headlined \"BREAKING FREE Brits hit parks and\nbeaches in first weekend since lockdown eased – as cops do spot checks”,\npublished on 16 May 2020.\n2. The article reported that millions of people had visited\nbeauty spots and holiday destinations following the easing of Coronavirus\nlockdown restrictions. The article featured a video of people walking on, and\nnear to, Weymouth Beach. \n3. A similar version of the video shot from different angle\nwas also published on the publication’s YouTube channel.\n4. The complainant said that the article was misleading as\nthe video was taken around six years ago and not recently as reported. She said\nthat her daughter was featured in the video walking out of the sea with her\nfriend; the complainant said that the only time they had spent time together at\nthis location was six years ago. The complainant said that the seafront had\nchanged in this time and produced annotated photographs of the scenery and how\nthe area had changed in order to support her position.\n5. The publication denied any breach of the code and it\nproduced a screenshot of the video’s Metadata which it said demonstrated that\nit was taken 16 May 2020. The publication also provided images from Google\nStreetview which it said proved that the developments from the video were\nconsistent with those featured in the footage.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n7. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n8. During IPSO’s investigation, the publication offered to\nremove the article from its website and the video from its YouTube channel as\nmeans to resolve the matter.\n9. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto her satisfaction. \n10. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 18/05/2020\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 03/08/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
