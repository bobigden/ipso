The\narticle reported that a “Derbyshire woman” had been jailed after stealing\n“£175,000 from her bosses to fund [a] luxury lifestyle”. The headline and the\ntext of the article described the 66-year-old woman as a “greedy grandmother”.\nThe article described various ways in which the woman had spent the money,\nincluding “fork[ing] out £60,000 on her niece's dream wedding” and paying for a\n“new extension, a landscaped garden, new driveway, exotic holidays and a\nhot-tub”.\n3. The\ncomplainants said that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1\n(Accuracy) as it described the woman as a “grandmother”, whereas the woman had\nno children or grandchildren.\n4. The\ncomplainants also said that the article breached Clause 1 as it incorrectly\ndescribed the individual as a “Derbyshire woman”, stating that the 66-year-old\nwas “from Derbyshire”. The complainants confirmed that the woman had never\nlived in Derbyshire, and that she had lived in Stoke-on-Trent for over twenty\nyears. In support of their position, the complainants provided the charge\nsheet, which listed the woman’s address as being in Werrington, Stoke-on-Trent.\n5. The\ncomplainants further said that the article was inaccurate as it stated that the\nwoman had “forked out £60,000 on her niece's dream wedding”, whereas the\nwedding cost approximately £25,000. The complainants provided the opening note\nfrom sentencing which stated that the niece’s wedding had cost “over £25k”.\nThey also said that the claims that the woman had spent the fraudulently\nobtained money on a “new extension… and a hot-tub” were inaccurate. The\ncomplainants variously claimed that the woman’s sister owned a hot tub and that\na previous partner of the woman purchased the hot tub in question, but that the\nwoman had never purchased one. Furthermore, the complainants said that it was\ninaccurate to state that the woman had paid for a new extension as she never\nhad an extension built. They added that as the property was rented, the woman\nwould not have been able to get an extension.\n6. The\npublication did not accept a breach of the Code. In relation to the description\nof the woman as a “grandmother”, the publication said they were provided with\nthis information by an agency who believed it to be true after viewing an online\npost about the woman’s birthday celebrations. The publication accepted that the\nagency was mistaken in this fact and it amended the article accordingly once\nthey were made aware of the complainant’s concerns. The publication also\noffered to publish the following footnote correction and apology, should it\nresolve the complaint:\nA\nprevious version of this article referred to Susan Bailey as a grandmother. We\nhave since been contacted by Ms Bailey's sister, who has advised that this is\nincorrect. We apologise for any distress which may have been caused.\n7. The\npublication had said that save for the description of the woman as a\n“grandmother”, the disputed points had been sourced from a Staffordshire Police\npress release, and that it was entitled to rely on the accuracy of any\ninformation contained in such a release by the police in this matter. It said\nthat it did not consider the details under dispute regarding the specific items\nthe money had been spent on were significant in the context of the article,\nwhich reported on the serious frauds of the woman and her subsequent\nprosecution and given the fact that the total sum of money obtained\nfraudulently was accurately reported in the article. Notwithstanding this, the\npublication removed the reference to “Derbyshire” from the online article but\nmade clear that this was with no admission of liability. The publication noted\nthat each count of fraud was not broken down in the prosecution’s note for\nsentencing, and that the note only gave examples of the nature of the woman’s\nspending during the course of her crimes, but not an exhaustive list. They\nmaintained their position that care was taken to be accurate prior to\npublication, in view of the fact that the information had come from an official\npolice publication.\n8. The\npublication further said that they had been in contact with Staffordshire\nPolice regarding the press release, and made clear that should the police\nadvise the newspaper of any changes to the release, it would be willing to\namend the article to reflect such changes. The police later informed the\npublication that they had received their own complaint from one of the\ncomplainants regarding the reporting of the ‘Derbyshire address’, but at that\ncurrent time they had no intentions of making any changes to the press release.\nThe publication said that in the absence of such changes and a substantive\nresponse from the police, it was not possible to verify the accuracy of the\ndetails under dispute.\n9.\nTowards the end of IPSO’s investigation, the publication said that if it would\naddress the complainants’ concerns, they would be willing to amend the figure\nof the wedding to £25,000; remove the references to a hot tub and an extension;\nand append a footnote to the article with the following wording:\nThis\narticle has been amended since publication to clarify the nature of the\nspending carried out by Susan Bailey while she perpetuated the fraud for which\nshe was convicted.\n10. The\ncomplainants did not accept the wording of either of the proposed clarifications\nas a resolution to their complaint, nor did they accept the amendments above.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly\nbetween comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n11. The\ncomplainants were concerned that the article had inaccurately described the\nwoman as “grandmother”, when she had no children or grandchildren. The claim\noriginated from an incorrect assumption made by the press agency based on\nphotographs from social media, which had not been checked. In these\ncircumstances, the publication had failed to take sufficient care not to\npublish inaccurate information, and the Committee found that there had been a\nbreach of Clause 1(i). It was the Committee’s view that, as the phrase\n“[g]reedy grandmother” was a prominent descriptor in the headline and repeated\nin the opening paragraph of the article, \nthis was a significant inaccuracy, and therefore the newspaper was\nobliged, in accordance with the terms of Clause 1(ii) to correct this promptly\nand with due prominence.\n12. The\nCommittee noted that once the publication had been made aware of the\ncomplainants’ concerns, it had amended the article to remove the references to\nthe woman being a “grandmother”, and also offered to publish a footnote\ncorrection. The wording of this correction identified the error and made the\ncorrect position clear, in addition to apologising to the woman. This was\noffered promptly and with sufficient prominence to meet the terms of Clause\n1(ii).\n13. The\nCommittee next considered the complainants’ concerns regarding the article’s\nclaim that the woman was “from Derbyshire” and the description of her as a\n“Derbyshire woman”. The publication had provided the police press release upon\nwhich it had relied; it stated that the woman was “living in Derbyshire”. The\nCommittee acknowledged that on some occasions reliance on a press release might\nnot be sufficient to demonstrate that a publication had taken care over the\naccuracy of the information it published. It considers each complaint on a\ncase-by-case basis, taking full consideration of the source of the release, its\ncontent, and any relevant external factors relating to the distribution of the\nrelease. The Committee noted that at the time of publication neither the rest\nof the information contained in the statement, nor any other information of\nwhich the publication could reasonably have been aware, indicated that the\noriginal press release issued by the police contained inaccuracies on this\npoint. In this instance, the Committee was satisfied that the publication was\nentitled to rely on the information contained in the press release issued by\nthe police. This demonstrated due care not to publish inaccurate or misleading\ninformation with regard to the location of where the woman now resided. There\nwas no breach of Clause 1(i) on this point.\n14. In\ncircumstances where the police had not removed the reference to Derbyshire in\nthe press release, and where they had made no comment on the accuracy of the\ninformation contained within the press release, the Committee were not in a\nposition to determine whether this point was inaccurate. The Committee noted\nhowever, that the publication had updated the article to remove the reference\nto Derbyshire. The Committee also noted that the police had confirmed that they\nhad been contacted by one of the complainants regarding the information in the\npress release, and given the evolving situation, the publication should be\nalert to any further changes to the press release. In any event, the Committee\nconsidered that where the woman was residing was not significant to the context\nof the whole article, and therefore, there was no breach of Clause 1(ii).\n15. The\ncomplainants also said that it was inaccurate for the article to claim that the\nwoman had purchased a hot tub, paid for a new extension and that she had “forked\nout £60,000 on her niece's dream wedding”. The publication had provided the\npolice press release which stated that the woman had bought a hot tub, paid for\nan extension, and paid for her niece’s £60,000 wedding. The Committee noted\nthat these points remained in the press release and had not been amended. The\nCommittee considered that due care had been taken not to publish inaccurate or\nmisleading information regarding these points. There was no breach of Clause\n1(i).\n16.\nWhere the disputed information remained online and where the police had made no\ncomment on whether the information included in the press release was\ninaccurate, the Committee was not in a position to determine whether it was\ninaccurate to state that the woman had purchased a hot tub, paid for a new\nextension, or had paid £60,000 for her niece’s wedding. In any event, the\nCommittee considered that these points were not significant to the context of\nthe whole article, particularly where the article correctly reported the total\nsum of money the woman obtained fraudulently. There was, therefore, no breach\nof Clause 1 (ii).\nConclusion(s)\n17. The\ncomplaint was partially upheld under Clause 1.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n18. The\ncorrection which was offered clearly put the correct position on record, and\nwas offered promptly and with due prominence, and should now be published.\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 23/04/21\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 08/12/21\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
