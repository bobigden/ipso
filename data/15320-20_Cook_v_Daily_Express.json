Michael\nCook complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that Daily\nExpress breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 12 (Discrimination) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in a letter headlined “End the PC nonsense and let’s\nall pull together now”, published on 14 August 2020.\n2. The\nletter had been written by a reader who described it as “nonsense” that it was\nconsidered racist for “non-black people” to braid their hair or tan. They asked\nfor people of all colour, race, religion or creed to “pull together”.\n3. The\ncomplainant, the reader who had written the letter, said that the published\nletter was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) as the newspaper had\nedited the letter he had originally sent to be published. His original letter\nhad also contained a sentence which stated that “Really? I suggest then that\nstraightening hair, blonding hair, wearing western clothing etc is also\nracist.”\n4. The\ncomplainant also said that by editing these words out of his letter the\nnewspaper had discriminated against him as a white person.\n5. The\npublication did not accept a breach of the Code. It said that it was satisfied\nthat not including the line that it removed did not alter the meaning of the\nletter.\n6. The\npublication said that as no pejorative or discriminative language was used there\nwas no breach of Clause 12.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\n7. Clause\n1 (Accuracy)\ni) The\nPress must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted\ninformation or images, including headlines not supported by the text.\nii) A\nsignificant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected,\npromptly and with due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology\npublished. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the\nregulator. \niii) A\nfair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for.\niv) The\nPress, while free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between\ncomment, conjecture and fact.\n8. Clause\n12 (Discrimination)\ni) The\npress must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference to an individual's, race,\ncolour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation or to any physical\nor mental illness or disability.\nii)\nDetails of an individual's race, colour, religion, gender identity, sexual\norientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided unless\ngenuinely relevant to the story.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n9. The\npublished letter clearly represented the complainant’s opinion that cultural\nappropriation was “nonsense”. Whilst the letter had been edited to remove the\ncomplainant’s argument that if it was racist for white people to braid their\nhair, or to tan then it should also be considered racist for non-white people\nto lighten their hair or change their style of dress – this did not change the\ncentral argument of the complainant’s letter: that it was “PC nonsense” for\neither of these things to be called racist. Where the point of the letter\nremained the same, the newspaper had not failed to take care not to publish\nmisleading information and there was no breach of Clause 1(i). As there was no\nsignificant inaccuracy, there was nothing to correct and no breach of Clause\n1(ii).\n10. The\nletter did not detail the complainant’s race, nor did it include any\nprejudicial or pejorative references. On this basis there was no breach of\nClause 12.\nConclusions\n11. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n12. N/A\n \nDate\ncomplaint received: 14/08/2020\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 20/11/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
