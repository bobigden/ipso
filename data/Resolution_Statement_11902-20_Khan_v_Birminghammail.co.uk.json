Asaf Khan\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that\nBirminghammail.co.uk breached Clause 1 of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Coronavirus hotspot Lozells is among first in country to get\n'walk through' test centre”, published on 6 July 2020.\n2. The online\narticle reported that a new ‘walk through’ COVID-19 testing centre was opening\nin Birmingham. It reported that centre was located “at the corner of Villa\nStreet and Nursery Street, in the heart of Lozells”.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) because\nthe test centre was located in Newtown, rather than in Lozells, and at the\ncorner of Villa Street and “Nursery Road”.\n4. The publication\ndid not accept that the article breached the Code, as it considered the alleged\ninaccuracies identified by the complainant minor and not significantly\ninaccurate or misleading. The publication also said that the information\nincluded in the article was based upon a press release by Birmingham City\nCouncil and published in good faith.\nRelevant Clause Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n5. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n6. During IPSO’s\ninvestigation, the publication offered to amend the online article, changing\nthe location of the test centre to Newtown and amending the address to Nursery\nStreet. The publication also offered to include the following correction as a\nfootnote:  \n“A previous version of this article stated that the test\ncentre was located in Lozells. This was based on a press release published by\nBirmingham City Council. We have since been advised that the test centre is in\nfact located in Newtown. We are happy to clarify this.”\n7. The complainant\nsaid that this would resolve the matter to his satisfaction.\n8. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 15/07/2020 \nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 12/11/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
