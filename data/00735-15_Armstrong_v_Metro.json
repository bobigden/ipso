Paul Armstrong complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation on behalf of James Armstrong that the Metro had breached\nClause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 3 (Privacy), Clause 4 (Harassment), and Clause 5\n(Intrusion into grief or shock) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Cancer victim Ellie, 14, was ‘nicest and happiest girl’”, published\non 21 January 2015. \n2. The complainant’s niece, Ellie Armstrong, died on 18\nJanuary 2015. This article was based on copy by a news agency, and was\npublished in a number of media outlets. It reported that Ellie Armstrong had\ndied of cancer, and that Cameron Armstrong, her brother, had revealed on\nTwitter that he had been diagnosed with the disease. It was largely based on information\nfrom social media. This included information from Ellie’s Facebook page, and\nexpressions of condolences from her classmates. It also reported on charity\nfundraising the complainant had undertaken while Ellie was ill. The complainant\nwas complaining on behalf of James Armstrong, the father of Ellie and her\nbrother Cameron. \n3. The complainant said that this article was researched\nand published in a manner which intruded into the grief of the Armstrong\nfamily. He was concerned that it was based on information taken from social\nmedia, and said that it contained inaccuracies as to the nature of Ellie’s\ntreatment. He said that approaches by the reporter to members of his family\nconstituted harassment.  \n4. The complainant said that the reporter made three\ncalls to a hair salon owned by the complainant’s wife, Angela Armstrong, on 20\nJanuary. Two of these calls were in the morning, prior to publication of a\nversion of the article, and the third was at 2pm, after publication. James\nArmstrong contacted the reporter at around 1pm after a version of the article\nappeared online, and he had been made aware that she was pursuing the story.\nThe complainant said that Mr Armstrong asked the reporter to stop pursuing the\nstory, and asked her not to contact the family, who wanted privacy to grieve\nfor their daughter. The complainant said that he was at this time making\nEllie’s funeral arrangements. The reporter did not agree to stop pursuing the\nstory, and Mr Armstrong ended the call abruptly.  The complainant said that\nthe reporter then made the third call to the salon, and told the employee who\nanswered that she had spoken to Mr Armstrong, and asked if she could clarify\nsome information he had given her. The complainant said that this was\ndeceitful; it gave the impression that Mr Armstrong had consented to the story.\nHe said that the third call to the salon, after Mr Armstrong had asked the\nreporter not to contact the family, was harassment under the terms of Clause 4\n(Harassment). \n5. Mr Armstrong also spoke to the news agency’s editor\nlater in the afternoon. He asked him not to continue with the story and told\nhim that it contained inaccuracies, and said that its publication would be\ndistressing for the family. The editor said that the agency would be proceeding\nwith the story, but that he would amend any inaccuracies. The complainant said\nthat the decision to proceed with the story without the family’s consent was\ninsensitive and intrusive where only two days had passed since  Ellie’s\ndeath, and while her brother was very ill in hospital. \n6. The article said that Ellie was “understood” to have\nreceived treatment abroad, and that “it is believed” that her treatment had\nbeen going on for “well over” a year. The complainant said that both these\nclaims were inaccurate; Ellie’s treatment lasted for the 10 months before her\ndeath, and she had not received treatment for the cancer abroad. \n7. The complainant was concerned that the article\ncontained information that Ellie had posted on social media. He said that she\nwas a 14 year old who would not have realised that this information could be\nused in this way. In relation to reporting Cameron’s comments on social media,\nthe complainant said that there was a difference between disclosing information\non an account for friends and family to read, and the same information being\nincluded in a newspaper article to which you did not consent. \n8. The newspaper said that the article was based on a\nreport from a news agency, and that the newspaper used it in good faith. \nThe newspaper said that it was not aware that the publication of the article\nwould be unwelcome when it was published. The newspaper said that the article\nwas a short and entirely sympathetic item about Ellie’s death, told from the\nviewpoint of her school friends. It accepted that the article was based on\ninformation from social media, but it said that a great many people use social\nmedia to communicate, and that it was reasonable for journalists to use\nmaterial from publically available social media pages. \n9. The newspaper said that the agency reporter first\ncalled the business owned by Ellie’s aunt after seeing a donation on the\ncomplainant’s Just Giving page, in which he was raising money for a cancer\ncharity for Ellie. The donation page noted that it was from the clients and\nstaff of a hair salon, and that it had been made by “A Armstrong”.  The\nreporter spoke to someone who worked at the salon, who agreed to pass on her\nnumber to the family. She called back an hour later to ask if her number had\nbeen passed on, and to see if anyone at the salon was willing to talk to her\nabout what had happened. She was told by the employee that the number had been\npassed on, but that she didn’t think anyone at the business would want to\ncomment. A version of the article was then published online. She then received\na call from Mr Armstrong, who told her that the story contained inaccuracies,\nbut provided no further detail. Mr Armstrong ended the phone call before she\nhad a chance to explain anything further. There was no request that she should\nleave the family alone.  Following this call, she called the salon for a\nthird time, to enquire whether anyone at the salon would be willing to clarify\nwhat the inaccuracies were. She did not try to suggest that the family had\nconsented to the story. The person the journalist spoke to said that she did\nnot want to help, and asked that she did not call them again.  Later that\nevening, Mr Armstrong contacted the editor of the news agency. He told him that\nthere were inaccuracies in the story, but did not specify what they were. \n10. The newspaper explained that the inaccuracies about\nEllie’s treatment for cancer had come about because her brother had made it\nknown that she had been flown to Germany for ongoing treatment. It said that\nwhere information could not be verified from more than one source, it had been\nprefaced with “it is believed…”.  It denied that the inaccuracies were\nsignificant, but offered to correct and apologise for the inaccuracies in the\narticle on page 2 of the Scottish edition of the newspaper. It also offered to\npublish an apology explaining that Ellie’s family have said that the\nnewspaper’s approaches were unwelcome, and apologising for any additional\ndistress caused as a result. The newspaper said that its Scottish editor was\nprepared to write a private letter to Ellie’s parents. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n11. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand - where appropriate - an apology published. In cases involving the\nRegulator, prominence should be agreed with the Regulator in advance. \niii) The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nClause 3 (Privacy) \ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. \nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into\nany individual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information. \nClause 4 (Harassment) \ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation,\nharassment or persistent pursuit. \nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on their\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent. \niii) Editors must ensure these principles are observed by\nthose working for them and take care not to use non-compliant material from\nother sources. \nClause 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock) \ni) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries\nand approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication\nhandled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings, such as inquests. \nFindings of the Committee\n12. The Committee expressed its condolences to the\nArmstrong family for their loss. It understood that this complaint related to\nevents which took place at a very difficult time for the family. \n13. Personal tragedy may be the subject of legitimate media\ncoverage, and the Committee noted that in this instance, the matter was already\nbeing discussed in the public domain by members of the community in which Ellie\nlived. While the Code requires that newspapers research and publish such\narticles in a manner which is sensitive to the personal grief of those close to\nthe deceased, this does not create a requirement that the family must consent\nto publication or an absolute prohibition on journalists approaching the family\nfor comment.  The Committee fully recognised that Ellie’s family did not\nat that time want the newspaper to report on her death, but this did not\nprovide grounds for establishing a breach of Clause 5.  It was not\ninappropriate for the reporter to ask the hair salon to pass on her contact details\nto the immediate family, nor were the calls to the hair salon indiscreet, or\nunsympathetic. In addition, the information taken from social media was\npublicly available, and was not of a private or inappropriate nature. In these\ncircumstances, the inclusion of this material was not intrusive or insensitive.\nThese aspects of the complaint did not raise a breach of Clause 3 or Clause 5. \n14. During the reporter’s second telephone call to the\nsalon, she was told by an employee that she did not think anyone at the salon\nwould want to comment, but she was not asked not to call the salon again. The\ncomplainant said that following this contact, James Armstrong told the\njournalist that she should not contact his family. In assessing whether there\nwas a breach of Clause 4 in relation to the journalist’s subsequent call to the\nsalon, the Committee took into account the full circumstances. While an\nemployee of the salon had previously said that they did not think anyone would\nwant to comment, the Committee noted the journalist’s explanation that she had\ncalled the salon to seek clarification on the inaccuracies Mr Armstrong had\nmade her aware of. There was no indication that the third call was a further\nattempt to contact Ellie’s parents or siblings. In these circumstances, the\nCommittee considered that the third call to the salon did not amount to\nharassment under the terms of Clause 4. \n15. The Committee noted the complainant’s concern that\nthe article did not accurately report the nature of Ellie’s treatment. However,\nit took the view that the exact duration of her treatment was not a significant\ndetail in the context of the article. Likewise, reporting that Ellie was\n“understood to have received treatment abroad”, where in fact, this treatment\nwas in relation to a separate condition, was not significantly\nmisleading.  As such, the Committee did not establish a breach of Clause\n1.  \nConclusions\n16. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 16/02/2015\nDate decision issued: 04/08/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
