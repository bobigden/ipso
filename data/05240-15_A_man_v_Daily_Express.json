A man complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that the Daily Express breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) and Clause 3\n(Privacy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article published in November\n2014. 2. The article reported that the complainant had been\nconvicted of a number of assaults. 3. The complainant identified what he believed to be a\nnumber of inaccuracies in relation to the statements of the victim in court. He\ncomplained that he had been pictured without his consent, in breach of Clause\n3. The article had also referred to him having previously received an absolute\ndischarge, following another offence, and he queried whether the newspaper\ncould report the absolute discharge. 4. The newspaper did not accept any breach of the Code.\nIt said that all of the alleged inaccurate statements had been heard in court;\nas such, the newspaper was entitled to report them. It said that the article\nhad made clear that they were heard in court, and in any case had correctly\nreported the specific charges of which the complainant was convicted. 5. The newspaper said that the complainant had been\nphotographed arriving at court to hear the verdict of the case. The photograph\nhad been taken in a public place where the complainant had no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy, and did not reveal any personal information about him,\nother than what he looked like. The newspaper also said that it was entitled to\nreport an absolute discharge. Relevant Code Provisions6. Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. Clause 3 (Privacy) i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into\nany individual’s private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosures of information. iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals in\nprivate places without their consent. Note – Private places are public or\nprivate property where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. Findings of the Committee7. The newspaper’s obligation was to report accurately\nwhat was heard in court; it was not required to independently investigate the\naccuracy of those statements. The article was an accurate report of court\nproceedings. There was no failure to take care over the accuracy of the\narticle, and the Committee did not identify any significant inaccuracies which\nwould require correction under the Code. 8. The newspaper was entitled to photograph the\ncomplainant outside the courtroom, so long as in doing so it did not breach any\nof the clauses of the Editors’ Code. The complainant had no reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in this location, and the published photograph did not\nreveal any private information about him. In addition, the newspaper was\nentitled to report the complainant receiving an absolute discharge, which was a\nmatter of public record. There was no breach of Clause 3. Conclusions9. The complaint was not upheld. Remedial Action RequiredN/A Date complaint received: 18/08/2015\nDate decision issued:\n01/12/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
