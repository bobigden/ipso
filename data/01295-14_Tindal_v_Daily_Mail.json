Mr Peter Tindal complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Daily Mail had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Exposed: The cruel farms\nthat’ll put you off mozzarella for life”, published online on 12 September 2014\nand in print on 13 September 2014. \n2. The article reported details of an investigation by\nanimal charity Four Paws into welfare standards at some buffalo farms in Italy,\nwhich produce milk used to make mozzarella di bufala Campana cheese. The\narticle reported that the animals in these farms had been mistreated. It also\nincluded some general information about the cheese. \n3. The complainant, who was an importer of mozzarella, said\nthat the article was one-sided and misleading, inaccurately suggesting that the\nfarms in question produced milk which was used to make mozzarella which would\nbe sold in UK supermarkets, and implying that these retailers were not\nconcerned about animal welfare, when in fact stringent tests are carried out.\nHe said that the publication of the article on a UK news website implied that\ncheese with poor welfare standards was on sale in Britain, as there was no\npublic interest reason for publication otherwise. He said that readers’\ncomments on the online article demonstrated that the misleading impression had\nbeen created that cheese from these farms was sold in the UK. He considered\nthat the newspaper should have made approaches to British suppliers of the\ncheese in order to gain a more balanced perspective on the story. \n4. The complainant also raised other concerns, relating to\nclaims about the way in which the cheese is packaged to be sold in the UK, and\nthe price at which it is on sale in supermarkets. Furthermore, the case of\nfraud, in which mozzarella had been found to contain “cheese analogue”, related\nto cheese made with cow’s milk, rather than buffalo’s. \n5. The newspaper did not accept that the article was\ninaccurate or misleading. It did not contain a direct claim that cheese made\nfrom milk from the farms under investigation was being sold in Britain. The\narticle reported an investigation into 50 farms in a certain region, and all\nmozzarella di bufala Campana has to be sourced from this area. Consumers of the\nproduct were entitled to know that there were welfare concerns about the\nindustry and region. The newspaper also did not accept that the article was\nunbalanced; it pointed out that it had included comments from Antonio Lucisano,\nDirector of the Consortium of Buffalo Mozzarella producers of Campania.\nQuestions had been put to all leading British supermarkets prior to\npublication, and the article had included their position, stating that they\n“were confident that their suppliers maintained high welfare standards”. \n6. Further, the statement about the way mozzarella was\npackaged to be sold was qualified by the use of the word “generally”, making\nclear that the description did not apply in all cases. The assertion was\nintended to refer to the production of top quality mozzarella in Italy, rather\nthan the way in which the cheese was sold in the UK. It also cited a\nsupermarket selling the product at £2 for 125g, exactly £16 per kilo, the\nfigure quoted in the article. \n7. The newspaper accepted that the case of fraud of\nmozzarella related to cow’s cheese. It accordingly published the following\nfootnote on the online article: \nWe are happy to clarify that the West Yorkshire fraud\nreferred to in the article involved cow’s milk mozzarella, not buffalo milk\ncheese. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n8. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni)The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii)A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \niii)The Press, whilst free to be partisan, must distinguish\nclearly between comment, conjecture and fact. \nFindings of the Committee\n9. The Committee did not share the complainant’s view that the\nmere existence of the story on a UK news website suggested that there was a\nlink between the farms under investigation and mozzarella on sale in the UK.\nNewspapers are entitled to publish stories which they believe will be of\ninterest to their readers, and are not obliged to provide a public interest\ndefence for the publication of all articles. \n10. The complainant had not disputed the findings of Four\nPaws regarding welfare standards at certain farms in the Campania region, and\nthe newspaper was entitled to rely on the charity’s report. There had been no\nfailure to take care not to publish inaccurate information on this point in\nbreach of Clause 1 (i). \n11. The Committee noted the article’s assertion that Britain\nis one of the largest importers of mozzarella from the region in question.\nWhile the Committee acknowledged the complainant’s strongly held position that,\nas an importer of mozzarella, he was not aware of any welfare issues\nsurrounding the product on sale in the UK, it noted that the article had not\nmade specific claims that the cheese made from milk from the farms under\ninvestigation was on sale in the UK. Had such claims been made, the newspaper\nwould have been expected to corroborate them. However, the Committee noted that\nthe complainant was not in a position to establish the provenance of all\nmozzarella di bufala Campana on sale in Britain. As such, the article’s\nimplication that there may be welfare issues was not significantly misleading.\nFurther, the article had made clear that British supermarkets which had been\ncontacted for comment “were confident their suppliers maintained high welfare\nstandards at all times”. The newspaper was not obliged to ask British\nmozzarella suppliers for their view on the story, particularly as the article had\nincluded extensive quotations from Antonio Lucisano, Director of the Consortium\nof Buffalo Mozzarella producers of Campania. \n12. The reference to mozzarella “generally” being “immersed\nin its own whey” and being a product that “should be eaten as soon as possible”\nwas not significantly misleading, given that, while mozzarella may not be sold\nthis way in British supermarkets, this description was accurate when\nconsidering the premium product available in Italy. The Committee was also\nsatisfied that the publication had taken care to check the price of mozzarella\nin certain supermarkets, and there was no breach of Clause 1 on this point. \n13. The newspaper’s decision to publish a footnote making\nclear that the West Yorkshire fraud had involved cow’s milk cheese was\nwelcomed. Nonetheless, in the context of an article focusing on the welfare of\nbuffaloes, and other concerns relating to the production of mozzarella, the\nfailure to make this point explicitly clear in the original article did not\nconstitute a significant inaccuracy raising a breach of Clause 1. \nConclusions\n14. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 13/10/2014\nDate decision issued: 14/01/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
