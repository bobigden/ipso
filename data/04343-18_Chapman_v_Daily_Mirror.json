Gillian Chapman\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Daily\nMirror breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an\narticle headlined “Suicide over menopause”, published on 30 June 2018.\n2. The article – a\n‘news in brief’ report of an inquest - stated that “a former mayor killed\nherself after struggling with the menopause”. It named this individual as\n‘Gillian Chapman, 55’. It described how the woman was found dead by her\ndaughter, and named the location of her home. The article included a photograph\nof ‘Gillian Chapman’.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that the article was inaccurate in breach of Clause 1 (Accuracy) because\nit had wrongly stated that she – the former mayor of the Borough of Dacorum –\nwas dead, when in fact the inquest had related to another woman of the same\nname. She said that the image in the article was of her, not the other woman.\n4. On receiving the\ncomplaint via IPSO, the publication accepted that it had published a significant\ninaccuracy that required correction. It subsequently offered to write a\npersonal letter of apology to the complainant, and to publish the following\ncorrection on page 2 of the print newspaper:\nAn article published on 30th June 2018 reported on the\ninquest into the suicide of Gillian Chapman. The article included inaccurate\ninformation supplied by a news agency that identified Ms Chapman as the former\nmayor of Dacorum. The subject of the inquest had the same name but was not the\nformer mayor. We would like to clarify that Gillian Chapman, the former mayor\nof Dacorum, has not passed away, and has no connection to the events described.\nWe would like to apologise to Mrs Chapman for the error and any distress\ncaused.\n5. The publication denied any breach of Clause 1, however. It\nsaid the story had been provided by an agency, which had failed to\nappropriately check the facts of the story. The publication said that it was\nreasonable for it to rely on the agency to correctly identify the subject of an\ninquest story; therefore, it had not itself failed to take care over the\nstory’s accuracy, in breach of Clause 1(i).\nRelevant Code Provisions\n6. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \nFindings of the Committee\n7. This article was\na report of an inquest, in which the deceased had been inaccurately identified.\nThis was a fundamental and damaging error on a basic point of fact. The\nCommittee considered that, in circumstances such as these, where the inaccuracy\nwas potentially damaging to an individual, and the correct position was readily\navailable, there had been a failure on the part of the agency providing the\nstory to take care over its accuracy. The Preamble to the Code makes clear that\npublications are ultimately responsible for any breaches of the Code that might\nresult from the use of external contributors. Consequently, there was a breach\nof Clause 1(i).\n8. As soon as the\nnewspaper became aware of the inaccuracy, it apologised and offered to correct\nthe article within 2 days. The subsequently offered correction made clear that the\nwoman referred to in the article was not the former mayor of Dacorum. The\nCommittee therefore considered that this correction addressed the inaccuracy\nfound in the original article, and it had been offered promptly once the\npublication was made aware of the inaccuracy. The offered correction also\nincluded an apology for the error that had been made, and to the complainant;\nthis was necessary to avoid a breach of Clause 1(ii), as the claim that the\ncomplainant had died by suicide was highly sensitive and personal in nature,\nand caused upset and confusion for her acquaintances. The publication had\noffered to publish the correction on page 2, in its Clarifications and\nCorrections column. The original story had been published on page 28, and the\ncolumn is an established feature of the publication; the offered correction was\ntherefore sufficiently prominent to meet the terms of Clause 1(ii). The\nremedial action offered was therefore sufficient to avoid a breach of Clause\n1(ii), and should now be published.\nConclusions\n9. The complaint\nwas upheld under Clause 1(i).\nRemedial action required\n10. On receipt of\nthe complaint, the publication had promptly offered a correction which\naddressed the inaccuracy within the article, was sufficiently prominent, and\nincluded an apology for the error. This was sufficient to meet the terms of\nClause 1(ii), and should now be published.The publication complained to the\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling\nthis complaint. The Independent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process\nwas not flawed and did not uphold the request for review.\nDate complaint received: 10/07/2018\nDate decision issued: 10/08/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
