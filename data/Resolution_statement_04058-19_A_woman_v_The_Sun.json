The article reported\ncomments from the woman’s parents regarding the couple’s relationship; they\nalso alleged that they had received letters from the Child Maintenance Service\n“demanding they pay her upkeep”. The article reported was accompanied by a\npixelated photograph of the woman on her wedding day, and in her school\nuniform. 3.    The complainant, the unnamed\nwoman referred to in the article, said that the article represented an\nintrusion into her privacy, and her time at school. She said that she was\nidentifiable from the information contained in the article, namely the\npublication of the name of her husband, her parents, and biographical details\nabout her. The complainant also said that it was inaccurate, in breach of\nClause 1, for the article to have claimed that her husband had “demanded” child\nsupport from her parents; she said that the DWP had confirmed that a claim had\nbeen issued due to an administrative error. 4.    The publication said that the\nrequirements of the Editors' Code were considered at length, prior to\npublication, and it was satisfied that there had been no breach of the Code. \nRelevant\nCode Provisions 5.    Clause 1 (Accuracy)  \ni) The Press must\ntake care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information or\nimages, including headlines not supported by the text. \nii) A significant\ninaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and\nwith due prominence, and — where appropriate — an apology published. In cases\ninvolving IPSO, due prominence should be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair\nopportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies should be given, when\nreasonably called for. \niv) The Press,\nwhile free to editorialise and campaign, must distinguish clearly between\ncomment, conjecture and fact. \nClause 2\n(Privacy)* \ni) Everyone is\nentitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and\ncorrespondence, including digital communications.\nii) Editors will\nbe expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without\nconsent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, account\nwill be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of information and\nthe extent to which the material complained about is already in the public\ndomain or will become so.\niii) It is\nunacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or\nprivate places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy. \nClause 6 (Children)* \ni) All pupils\nshould be free to complete their time at school without unnecessary intrusion.\nii) They must not\nbe approached or photographed at school without permission of the school\nauthorities.\niii) Children\nunder 16 must not be interviewed or photographed on issues involving their own\nor another child’s welfare unless a custodial parent or similarly responsible\nadult consents. \nMediated\noutcome 6.    The complaint was not resolved\nthrough direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an\ninvestigation into the matter. 7.    During IPSO’s investigation, the\npublication offered to remove the article from its website, which the\ncomplainant confirmed resolved the complaint to her satisfaction. 8.    As the complaint was successfully\nmediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether\nthere had been any breach of the Code. Date\ncomplaint received: 07/05/2019 Date\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 19/06/2019\n \n  \n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
