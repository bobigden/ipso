Eloise Dixon\ncomplained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that the Birminghammail.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3 (Harassment)\nand Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock) of the Editors’ Code of Practice\nin an article headlined “First picture of Eloise Dixon, Brit tourist shot in\nBrazil ‘while looking for water’”, published on 8 August 2017.\n2. The article\nreported that the complainant was being treated in hospital having been shot\nwhile holidaying with her family in Brazil. It said that the family had entered\na rough neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro because of a language mix-up.\n3. The complainant\nsaid that reporters had harassed her family while she was being treated in\nhospital and while they were all traumatised and in shock. She said the\nnewspaper had also taken Facebook photographs and had published them without\ntheir consent. In addition, it had based its report on inaccurate information given\nby the Brazilian police: the family had not driven into a rough neighbourhood\nbecause they were looking for water and had misunderstood directions given to\nthem; in fact, the sat-nav had misdirected them.\n4. The newspaper\nsaid that it was sorry to hear of the complainant’s ordeal, but it did not\naccept any breach of the Code. It said that its article had been based on\ninformation given by the police; it had no reporters present in Brazil and it\nhad made no attempt to question or photograph the family. The images it had\npublished had been taken from a Facebook profile, which was open to the public.\nGiven the complainant’s concern that the article was inaccurate, it said that\nit would be happy to add a footnote to it to clarify her version of events.\nRelevant Code provisions\n5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nClause 3 (Harassment) \ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\niii)  Editors must\nensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care\nnot to use non-compliant material from other sources.\nClause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock) \nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings.\nMediated outcome\n6. The complaint\nwas not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties. IPSO\ntherefore began an investigation into the matter.\n7. During IPSO’s\ninvestigation of the complaint, the newspaper offered to amend the online\narticle and to append the following note:\nA previous version of this article was based on information\nprovided by the Police and official statements at the time. We have since been\nnotified that Ms Dixon and her family were not looking for water and did not\nask for directions, but that the car's navigation system directed them the\nwrong way. We would also like to clarify that at no time did the gunmen speak\nto Ms Dixon or her family.\n8. The complainant\naccepted the newspaper’s offer as a resolution to her complaint.\n9. As the complaint\nwas successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.\nDate complaint received: 09/10/2017\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 07/02/2018\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
