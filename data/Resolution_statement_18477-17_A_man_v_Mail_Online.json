A man complained\non his own behalf, and on behalf of his wife and his mother, to the Independent\nPress Standards Organisation that Mail Online breached Clause 2 (Privacy),\nClause 3 (Harassment) and Clause 9 (Reporting of crime) of the Editors’ Code of\nPractice in an article headlined “Boyfriend of Holby city actor’s daughter is\nreleased from custody as friends reveal how she looked “odd and unsteady” in\nthe hours before her “drug related” death at Bestival”, published on 12\nSeptember 2017, and an article headlined “Boyfriend arrested over [name]’s\ndeath released song about a girl disrespecting him and ‘crushing’ his ‘heart\nand soul’ just days earlier”, published on 14 September 2017.2. The articles\nreported that the complainant’s son had been initially arrested on suspicion of\ncommitting a serious offence against his girlfriend at a music festival, but\nreported that he had later been re-arrested on suspicion of supplying Class A\ndrugs. The articles identified the complainant and his wife, and reported\nbiographical details about them. The article also included statements which the\ncomplainant’s mother had made to a journalist.3. The complainant\nsaid that he had no relevance to the story, nor did his wife; the inclusion of\ntheir names in the article was an intrusion into their privacy. The complainant\nalso expressed concern about the presence of journalists outside his home when\nhis son was first arrested; he said that journalists had remained on his\nproperty and had shouted through his letter box.4. The publication\nsaid that direct family members of those arrested on suspicion of serious\ncrimes will often be considered genuinely relevant to the story. It noted that\nthe articles had included minimal details of the complainant and his wife, and\nargued that it was in the public interest to report on developments in a story\nand provide a full picture of those suspected of a serious crime. While it did not accept a breach of the Code,\nit removed all references to the complainant and his wife from the articles.5. The publication\ndenied that a journalist acting on their behalf had acted in the manner alleged\nby the complainant. It said that its journalist had spoken to the complainant’s\nmother, who had been happy to provide him with her comments. It said that when\nthe same journalist had approached the complainant, the complainant had made\nclear that he did not wish to comment and so no further approaches had been\nmade.  Relevant Code provisions6. Clause 2\n(Privacy)*i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.Clause 3 (Harassment) *i) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.ii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.iii) Editors must ensure these principles are observed by\nthose working for them and take care not to use non-compliant material from\nother sources.Clause 9 (Reporting of Crime)i) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of\ncrime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they are\ngenuinely relevant to the story.Mediated outcome7. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.8. During IPSO’s investigation, the matter was settled\nprivately and to the complainant’s satisfaction.9. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 13/09/2017Date complaint concluded: 19/01/2018   \n \n \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
