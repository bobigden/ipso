The objective of the study had been to assess whether the use of a mask reduced the wearer’s risk of contracting Covid-19; it had not assessed whether wearing a mask affected the onwards transmission of Covid-19 from the mask wearer to others. The statement in the article that the study found masks to be “useless”, without explaining what function of mask wearing was being assessed, was misleading:  the study had not found masks to be ineffective in the onwards transmission of Coivd-19 from wearer to others. Furthermore, the article had not mentioned that the study had made clear that the findings concerning the effectiveness of masks in reducing the risk of infection for the wearer were “inconclusive”. The newspaper had, therefore failed to take care not to publish misleading information and there was a breach of Clause 1(i). The fact that the columnist had previously written about the study in more depth in other articles did not justify the omission of crucial details in this article. Where the article had stated that the study had shown that wearing masks was useless, when the study had not found this, the misleading statement was significant and required correction under Clause 1(ii). No correction was offered, and there was a breach of Clause 1(ii). 10. The publication had also provided commentary on the efficacy of masks from other sources, however, this was not relevant to the reporting of the results of the Danmask-19 study. 11. The publication said that the assertion that the results of the study showed masks to be “useless” was the columnist’s opinion, which he was entitled to express. The Committee noted that, while columnists are indeed free to comment on research and share their interpretation of data, this must be based in fact and clearly distinguished as comment or conjecture. In this instance, whilst the quote had appeared in a comment piece, the statement that the study had found masks to be “useless” was presented as a fact, and not distinguished as comment. There was a breach of Clause 1(iv). Conclusions 12. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1.",
    "remedial_action": "13. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1(i), Clause 1(ii) and Clause 1(iv), the Committee considered what remedial action should be required. In circumstances where the Committee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the publication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of which is determined by IPSO. 14. The Committee considered that the publication did not take the necessary care when reporting the outcome of the study. The Committee considered that the appropriate remedy was the publication of a correction to put the correct position on record. A correction was considered to be sufficient, as the result of the study was not the focal point of the article. 15. The Committee then considered the placement of the correction. It should appear as a footnote to the article online if the article is amended, and under the headline if the article is not amended. It should also appear in the print version of the paper in the established corrections and clarifications column. The correction needed to record that the article had claimed that the study had found that wearing masks were “useless” when in fact the study had only considered whether mask wearers were less likely to contract the virus, and that the results were inconclusive. It should state that it has been published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation.

    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision of the Complaints Committee – 00322-21 Evans v\nThe Mail on Sunday\nSummary of Complaint\n1. Richard Evans complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that The Mail on Sunday breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of\nthe Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Shot down by Facebook’s\nidiot censors”, published on 13 December 2020.\n2. The article was a comment piece which reported on\nFacebook censoring posts. It reported that the columnist had “been given\nFacebook’s seal of disapproval” after he posted about “Covid muzzles” (face\nmasks) and had stated that “a major experiment shows they’re useless”.\n3. The article also appeared online in substantially the\nsame format.\n4. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1. He said that the study the article referred to must have\nbeen the Danmask-19 experiment. He said that the article was therefore\nmisleading for three reasons: firstly, the study suggested that those wearing\nmasks had a 14% lower risk of contracting Covid-19; secondly, the study had\nstated that the numbers of Covid-19 cases amongst participants was not high\nenough to reach statistical significance and the study was therefore\ninconclusive; and thirdly, because the study did not test whether masks stop\nthe wearer transmitting the virus, only whether it stops the mask wearer being\ninfected themselves, when the former was the main reason behind Government\nadvice to wear masks. He said that on this basis it was inaccurate to report\nthat the study had found them useless.\n5. The publication did not accept a breach of the Code. It\nconfirmed that the study referred to was the Danmask-19 study. It said the\nfindings of this study were that 1.8% of people wearing masks got Covid-19,\ncompared to a control group without masks of which 2.1% got Covid-19. It said\nthat the researchers found that this was not statistically significant and that\nthe data was “compatible with lesser degrees of self-protection”, which it said\nmeant mask wearers were not better protected than non-mask wearers to the\nextent that it was statistically significant. The publication said that the\nstudy was large and rigorous, and the fact that the study only considered\nwhether wearing masks protected the wearer did not make it inaccurate to\ndescribe the findings as stating masks were “useless”. It said that there were\nno randomised control studies which tested whether wearing a mask lowered\ntransmission from the mask wearer. The publication said the columnist had\npreviously described this study in greater detail in other articles. It also\nreferred to several quotes about the effectiveness of masks, including that in\nMarch 2020 the World Health Organisation had stated: “There is currently no\nevidence that wearing a mask (whether medical or other types) by healthy\npersons in the wider community setting, including universal community masking,\ncan protect them from infection” and that in March 2020, England’s Chief\nMedical Officer said wearing a face mask had almost no effect on reducing the\nrisk of contracting coronavirus, stating: ”In terms of wearing a mask, our advice\nis clear: that wearing a mask if you don’t have an infection reduces the risk\nalmost not at all. So we do not advise that”, while noting that if someone was\ninfected, they might reduce the danger of spreading the disease by covering\ntheir faces, he said wearing a face mask had almost no effect on reducing the\nrisk of contracting the illness. The publication said that these quotes\ndemonstrated that, prior to the study referred to in the article, the default\nposition was that there was no specific evidence to show that wearing masks\nprevented the spread of Covid-19 from the wearer or protected the wearer from\nothers.\n6. The publication also said that the statement that the\nstudy showed masks were “useless” was the columnist’s opinion, and that it was a\npassing reference in a comment piece. It said it was the complainant’s view\nthat the study was “inconclusive” and that the columnist did not accept this\nview, and it was his personally held belief that a result of not statistically\nsignificant was conclusive.\n7. The complainant responded by saying that the 0.3\npercentage points difference was a function of the low number of Covid-19 cases\nin people in the study, rather than the size of the effect of wearing masks. He\nalso noted that in the population of the UK, even the difference observed in\nthe study had the potential to stop thousands of people contacting Covid-19,\nwhich was not “useless”. The complainant said it was not a matter of opinion\nthat the study was inconclusive, but that the first point listed in the\nlimitation section of the study was “inconclusive results”, and the study also\nreported that “The most important limitation is that the findings are\ninconclusive”. The complainant also said that there is a point at which stating\nan opinion becomes an assertion of fact and that the article had passed this\npoint, and therefore it was not a defence that the inaccuracy was within a\ncomment piece.\n8. The complainant accepted the quotations provided by the\npublication, but noted that they were from March 2020 and disagreed that the\ndefault position before the study was that masks were useless. He also said\nthat other quotes on the efficacy of masks were not relevant to his complaint,\nwhich was that reporting that the Danmask-19 study said that masks were\n“useless” was inaccurate.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n9. The Committee firstly made clear that newspapers have an\nobligation to take care not to publish inaccurate information, even in comment\npieces. The columnist was entitled to share his interpretation of the study in\nthe column, provided it was clearly presented as such and readers would not be\nmisled as to the study’s conclusions. Both parties were in agreement as to\nwhich study was being referred to: the Danmask-19 study. The objective of the\nstudy had been to assess whether the use of a mask reduced the wearer’s risk of\ncontracting Covid-19; it had not assessed whether wearing a mask affected the\nonwards transmission of Covid-19 from the mask wearer to others. The statement\nin the article that the study found masks to be “useless”, without explaining\nwhat function of mask wearing was being assessed, was misleading:  the study had not found masks to be\nineffective in the onwards transmission of Coivd-19 from wearer to others.\nFurthermore, the article had not mentioned that the study had made clear that\nthe findings concerning the effectiveness of masks in reducing the risk of\ninfection for the wearer were “inconclusive”. The newspaper had, therefore\nfailed to take care not to publish misleading information and there was a\nbreach of Clause 1(i). The fact that the columnist had previously written about\nthe study in more depth in other articles did not justify the omission of\ncrucial details in this article. Where the article had stated that the study\nhad shown that wearing masks was useless, when the study had not found this,\nthe misleading statement was significant and required correction under Clause\n1(ii). No correction was offered, and there was a breach of Clause 1(ii).\n10. The publication had also provided commentary on the\nefficacy of masks from other sources, however, this was not relevant to the\nreporting of the results of the Danmask-19 study.\n11. The publication said that the assertion that the results\nof the study showed masks to be “useless” was the columnist’s opinion, which he\nwas entitled to express. The Committee noted that, while columnists are indeed\nfree to comment on research and share their interpretation of data, this must\nbe based in fact and clearly distinguished as comment or conjecture. In this\ninstance, whilst the quote had appeared in a comment piece, the statement that\nthe study had found masks to be “useless” was presented as a fact, and not\ndistinguished as comment. There was a breach of Clause 1(iv).\nConclusions\n12. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1.\nRemedial Action Required\n13. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1(i), Clause 1(ii) and\nClause 1(iv), the Committee considered what remedial action should be required.\nIn circumstances where the Committee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code,\nit can require the publication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the\nterms and placement of which is determined by IPSO.\n14. The Committee considered that the publication did not\ntake the necessary care when reporting the outcome of the study. The Committee\nconsidered that the appropriate remedy was the publication of a correction to\nput the correct position on record. A correction was considered to be\nsufficient, as the result of the study was not the focal point of the article.\n15. The Committee then considered the placement of the\ncorrection. It should appear as a footnote to the article online if the article\nis amended, and under the headline if the article is not amended. It should\nalso appear in the print version of the paper in the established corrections\nand clarifications column. The correction needed to record that the article had\nclaimed that the study had found that wearing masks were “useless” when in fact\nthe study had only considered whether mask wearers were less likely to contract\nthe virus, and that the results were inconclusive. It should state that it has\nbeen published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation. The full wording and position should be agreed with IPSO in\nadvance\n \nDate complaint received: 08/01/2021\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 07/04/2021\n \nIndependent Complaints Reviewer\nThe publication complained to the Independent Complaints\nReviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did\nnot uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
