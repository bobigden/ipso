    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nResolution Statement – 02697-21 Roberts v Telegraph.co.uk\nSummary of Complaint\n1. Owen Roberts complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that Telegraph.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Travel news latest: Wales to\nban English tourists until at least the summer”, published on 12th March 2021.\n2. The online article, a live travel blog, reported on the\nreopening of self-contained accommodation in Wales following the comments made\nby First Minister Mark Drakeford on BBC Radio 4’s Today programme. The article\nstated that when accommodation reopened at Easter, “English holidaymakers”\nwould not be able to visit Wales.  \n3. The complainant said that the article was misleading in\nbreach of Clause 1 (Accuracy), as its headline gave the impression that the Welsh\nGovernment and its First Minister, Mark Drakeford, had “banned” English\nholidaymakers from visiting Wales when it was, in fact, the result of a UK\nGovernment’s own restriction which did not permit unnecessary travel outside of\nEngland.\n4. The publication did not accept a breach of the Code. It\nmaintained that the text of the article supported and clarified the headline.\nIt said that the headline was based upon the comments made by the First\nMinister on the Today programme and to the Press Association, with the First\nMinister explaining to the latter that self-contained accommodation providers\n“should not be taking booking from people who live outside [of] Wales”.  It further noted that the article was a live\ntravel blog and as such was updated throughout the course of the day, with the\nheadline later amended to “Wales to reopen self-catering stays for Easter – but\nnot for the English”.\n5. Notwithstanding this, in order to resolve the complaint,\nthe publication, upon receipt of the complaint, offered to include a footnote\nclarification to make clear that it was due to UK Government’s own restrictions\nthat English holidaymakers would not be able to visit Wales.\n6. The complainant considered that the remedial action\noffered by the publication was inadequate, as it was not sufficiently\nprominent, and did not address the inflammatory implication that the Welsh\nGovernment had made a decision to “ban” English holidaymakers.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n7. The complaint was not resolved through direct\ncorrespondence between the parties. IPSO therefore began an investigation into\nthe matter.\n8. During IPSO’s investigation, the publication offered to\npublish the following clarification at the top of the online article:\n“An earlier version of this blog carried the headline 'Wales\nto ban English tourists until at least the summer'. We have been asked to make\nclear that the ban was in relation to the Prime Minister's lockdown roadmap.”\n9. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto his satisfaction.\n10. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 13/03/2021\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 04/05/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
