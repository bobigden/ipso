Marvin Foster complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that Event Magazine had breached Clause 1 (Accuracy),\nClause 2 (Opportunity to reply), Clause 3 (Privacy), Clause 4 (Harassment),\nClause 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock), Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and\nsubterfuge) and Clause 14 (Confidential sources) in an article headlined “Staff\nWarehouse workers begin employment tribunal process”, published on 25 March\n2015. 2. The article reported that employees previously hired\nby Staff Warehouse were beginning the employment tribunal process over concerns\nabout non-payment. The complainant, managing director of Staff Warehouse, was\nquoted in the article as saying that “these staff are being paid”. 3. The complainant was concerned that the article was\ninaccurate as workers had not begun the employment tribunal process. He also\nsaid that the article represented a breach of Clause 3 (Privacy) and Clause 14\n(Confidential sources) as the article had included comments from his\ncorrespondence, which he said was not intended for publication. His comment had\nbeen included in an email which had said he would “not engage” with the\nmagazine. 4. The complainant said that the newspaper had breached\nClause 4 (Harassment) as he had spoken to the publication and asked them to\n“leave it” as he was dealing with the staff himself. He also said that the\narticle represented a breach of Clause 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock). 5. The complainant also expressed concern that the\nmagazine had spoken to former employees who had recorded conversations without\nconsent, in breach of Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge). 6. The magazine did not accept that the article\nrepresented a breach of Code. It said that the article was of significant\npublic interest, and proper steps had been taken prior to publication to verify\nits accuracy. 7. The magazine said that it had become aware of a\nFacebook group which contained comments from people who claimed to be owed\nmoney by the company. The reporter had contacted the complainant who had\nadmitted that there were a few “slightly delayed” payments but it was “nothing\nmajor”. 8. The reporter was contacted by members of the group,\nsome of whom wished to remain anonymous and some of whom were happy to go on\nrecord. One of the people she interviewed said that he was owed £872. The\nmagazine took the view that there was a public interest in the story, and\ndecided to ask the complainant for further comment. 9. The complainant had emailed the reporter and said “I\nwill not engage with either you or your staff as you are part of the FB\n[Facebook] chain / Group which violated me as a person. These staff are being\npaid”. The complainant’s response did not say that these comments were not for\npublication. As it was said in response to a request for comment, the magazine\nconsidered that it had been reasonable to assume his comments could be\npublished. 10. The magazine subsequently received confirmation of\nthe commencement of the employment tribunal process via the Advisory, Conciliation\nand Arbitration Service (Acas) Early Conciliation Service. It provided a copy\nof the certificate. 11. The magazine offered the complainant the opportunity\nto participate in a follow up article. The complainant declined to participate. Relevant Code Provisions12. Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. Clause 2 (Opportunity to reply) A fair opportunity to reply to inaccuracies must be given\nwhen reasonably called for. Clause 3 (Privacy) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications. Clause 4 (Harassment) i) Journalists must not engage in intimidation,\nharassment or persistent pursuit. ii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on their\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent. Clause 5 (Intrusion into grief or shock) i) In cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries\nand approaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication\nhandled sensitively. This should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings, such as inquests. Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge) The press must not seek to obtain or publish material\nacquired by using hidden cameras or clandestine listening devices. Clause 14 (Confidential source) Journalists have a moral obligation to protect\nconfidential sources of information. Findings of the Committee13. The magazine had spoken to former employees, some of\nwhom had commented on the record. It had asked the complainant for comment on\nthe allegations of non-payment, and had obtained documentation from the\nAdvisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service which indicated that employees\nhad taken the first step to commence proceedings. The Committee was therefore\nsatisfied that the magazine had not failed to take care over the accuracy of\nthe article. There was no breach of Clause 1 (i). On the basis of the evidence\nprovided by the magazine, the Committee did not find that it had been\ninaccurate to report that workers were beginning the employment tribunal\nprocess. There was no breach of Clause 1. 14. The article had included the complainant’s comment\nthat “these staff are being paid”.  While the Committee noted the\ncomplainant’s position that he had not intended this comment for publication,\nit had been included in correspondence to the magazine in response to a request\nfor comment, and the correspondence had not made clear that it was not for\npublication. The remark did not include any private information and its\npublication did not represent an intrusion into his privacy. There was no\nbreach of Clause 3. There had been no suggestion that the complainant should be\nconsidered a confidential source. There was no breach of Clause 14. 15. The magazine had attempted to contact the complainant\nfor comment prior to the publication of the article to ensure that the article\naccurately reflected his position. There was no suggestion that the reporter\nhad made approaches to the complainant following a request to desist. There was\nno breach of Clause 4. 16. Clause 2 provides individuals the opportunity to\nrespond to published inaccuracies when reasonably called for. The Committee had\nnot established the existence of inaccuracies such as to have engaged the terms\nof the Code. Nonetheless, it welcomed the magazine’s offer for the complainant\nto contribute to a follow-up article. 17. The terms of Clause 5 relate to the obligations of\npublications when reporting on instances of personal grief or shock, and are\ndesigned to protect victims, and their families, from unwanted journalistic\nintrusion and insensitivity when they are at their most vulnerable. Coverage\nabout the complainant’s business did not engage the terms of Clause 5. 18. The Committee noted that the complainant had also\nexpressed concern that former employees had recorded conversations without his\nconsent. The complainant had not suggested that the magazine had sought to\nobtain, or published, material acquired by use of a clandestine device. The\nterms of Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge) were not engaged. Conclusions19. The complaint was not upheld. Remedial Action RequiredN/A Date complaint received: 26/03/2015\nDate decision issued: 25/06/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
