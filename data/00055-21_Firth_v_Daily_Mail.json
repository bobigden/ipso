Jonathan Firth complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Daily Mail breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Look out, Boris... this may\nbe Britain's destiny all too soon”, published on 1 January 2021.\n2. The article was a comment piece from the perspective of\nan imaginary news editor in the year 2024, reflecting over the past few years.\nWhen considering coronavirus the article reported that “in the first 50 weeks\nof 2020, mortality was only marginally higher than the average for the previous\nten years.”\n3. The article also appeared online in substantially the\nsame format under the headline “Look out Boris, Rishi may be Britain's destiny\nall too soon: A big majority, a vaccine, a Brexit deal. But in a New Year gaze\ninto his crystal ball, JOHN HUMPHRYS sees a very unexpected twist for the PM”.\n4. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate in\nbreach of Clause 1, as the Office of National Statistics had set the mean death\nrate for England as 10.381 per 1000 people, in comparison to 9.2189 for\n2010-2019, equalling a 12.6% increase. He said that this could not be described\nas “marginal” as it was almost ten standard deviations away from the mean, and\nthat the term “marginal” implied that there was very little difference to\nprevious years, when tens of thousands of people had died due to the pandemic.\n5. The publication did not accept that the article was\ninaccurate on this point. It said that the disputed figure was the death rate,\nrather than the raw figures for number of deaths. It said this figure came from\na report published by the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries which showed that\nin the first 50 weeks of 2020, mortality in England and Wales was “6.9% above\nthe 2010-2019 average”. It said that a “marginal” increase was a matter of\nsubjective interpretation, and that the article was entitled to characterise\nthe rise of 6.9% as marginal. Whilst it did not rely on the figures prior to\npublication, the newspaper noted that the Office of National Statistics had\nnoted that age-standardised mortality rate for 2020 was 1,043.5 per 100,000,\nwhich was 7.2% higher. It noted that the article was clearly a comment piece\nfocusing on the government’s response to Covid-19, and made clear to\ndistinguish between comment conjecture and fact in style and tone, including by\nthe columnist describing himself as an editor from the future.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n6. The question for the Committee was whether the mortality\nrate in the first 50 weeks of 2020 could be described as “only marginally\nhigher than the average” without breaching the Code which requires the press to\ntake care not to publish inaccurate, misleading or distorted information.\nWhilst including the precise figure of 6.9% would have been clearer, the Committee\nconsidered that “marginally higher” did not have a defined meaning. The article\nwas clearly a comment piece, and therefore the term “marginally higher” would\nbe understood to be the columnist’s interpretation. Where the publication had\nrelied on government statistics that had placed the 2020 death rate at 6.9%\nhigher than the average over the past ten years, it was not misleading for the\ncolumnist to characterise a rise of 6.9% as “marginally higher”. On this basis,\nthe publication had not failed to take care not to publish inaccurate\ninformation, and there was no breach of Clause 1.\nConclusions\n7. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n8. N/A\n\nDate complaint received: 02/01/2021\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 13/05/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
