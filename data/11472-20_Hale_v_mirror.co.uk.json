Craig Hale complained to the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation that mirror.co.uk breached Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3\n(Harassment) and Clause 9 (Reporting of crime) in an article headlined “Stalker\nposts champagne celebration snaps as early jail release angers victims”\npublished 16 October 2019.\n2. The article reported on the complainant’s partner being\nreleased “after serving just a quarter of her one-year sentence behind bars”.\nIt contained a picture of the complainant and his partner captioned: “[named\nperson] celebrated her release from prison with her partner Craig Hale [the\ncomplainant]”. The article also made reference to the original criminal\nconviction of the complainant’s partner.\n3. The complainant said the article breached Clause 2 as it\npublished his name, an image of him taken from his partner’s public social\nmedia account and the fact of his relationship. He also said that the\npublication breached Clause 2 by associating him with someone accused and\nconvicted of crime, namely his partner; something he also said gave rise to a\nbreach of Clause 9. He confirmed that he had attended two of his partner’s\ncourt appearances; posted publicly about an IPSO ruling of May 2020 which\nrelated to the criminal accusations against her; addressed the case against his\npartner on Twitter after this; and, was pictured in public social media posts\nby his partner which celebrated her release from prison and that showed the\npair as a couple. Finally, the complainant said that the publication of the article\nconstituted harassment. \n4. The publication did not accept it had breached the Code.\nOn Clause 9, it said that he was genuinely relevant to the story. It also noted\nthat the complainant appeared in court during his partner’s trial, to support\nher, and posted publicly on Twitter about the case, identifying himself in\nrelation to it. It also said such activity effectively meant he had consented\nto being identified in relation to the accusations against his partner. In\nrelation to Clause 2, it stated that the fact of a relationship is not private\ninformation and that, in any event, a number of public social media posts\nshowed the pair as a couple. It pointed to the fact that it was accepted that\nthe photograph was taken from a public social media page and only displayed the\ncomplainant’s likeness. As the complainants concerns under Clause 3 did not\nrelate to the conduct of journalists, the publication said the Clause was not\nengaged.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 2 (Privacy)*\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. In considering an individual's\nreasonable expectation of privacy, account will be taken of the complainant's\nown public disclosures of information and the extent to which the material\ncomplained about is already in the public domain or will become so.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\n6. Clause 3 (Harassment)*\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\niii)  Editors must\nensure these principles are observed by those working for them and take care\nnot to use non-compliant material from other sources.\n7. Clause 9 (Reporting of crime)*\ni) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of\ncrime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they are\ngenuinely relevant to the story.\nFindings of the Committee\n8. The first stage of any decision under Clause 9 is to\nassess whether the complainant was identified as the friend or relative of\nsomeone accused or convicted of crime. The article referred to the complainant\nas a “partner” of a person convicted of crime. The complainant was identified\nas the friend or relative of someone accused or convicted of crime.\n9. The Committee then assessed whether the complainant was\ngenuinely relevant to the story within the meaning of Clause 9. The article\nreported on the criminal proceedings against the complainant’s partner, her\nconviction and her subsequent release from jail. The complainant confirmed that\nhe had attended court twice to support his partner during the same criminal\nproceedings. He had also been pictured in photo in public social media posts by\nhis partner which celebrated her release from prison. In this context, he was\ngenuinely relevant to the story. There was no breach of Clause 9.\n10. The Committee next considered whether the complainant’s\nname and the fact of his relationship was private. Neither a person’s name nor\nthe fact of a relationship is generally information about which a person has a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. The Committee also noted the number of\npublic social media posts which showed the pair as a couple and the fact the\ncomplainant had attended court to support his partner. There was no breach of\nClause 2.\n11. The complainant had argued that associating him with\nsomeone accused and convicted of crime, namely his partner, gave rise to a\nbreach of Clause 2. Clause 9 was the correct Clause under which to consider\nthis concern and the Committee had done so fully. The association between the\ncomplainant and his partner, in circumstances where she was accused or\nconvicted of crime, did not give rise to any additional issue under Clause 2;\nespecially as the fact of the couple’s relationship was not private. There was\nno breach of Clause 2.\n12. The image of the complainant was taken from his\npartner’s public social media page and only showed his likeness. As such, the\ncomplainant did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy over this\ninformation. There was no breach of Clause 2.\n13. The complainant had said that the publication of the\narticle constituted harassment. Clause 3 generally relates to the way\njournalists behave when researching a news story and is meant to protect people\nfrom being repeatedly approached by the press against their wishes. In\naddition, there was one article under complaint; it focused predominantly on\nthe complainant’s partner; and the complainant was in any event relevant to the\nstory. There was no breach of Clause 3.\nConclusions\n14. The complaint was not upheld.\nRemedial Action Required\n15. N/A\n \nDate complaint received: 03/07/2020\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 03/02/2021\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
