John Graham complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Belfast Telegraph had breached Clause 1\n(Accuracy) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined, “Why it’s\ntime to man up about the problem of depression”, published on 1 December 2014. \n2. The article was an analysis of the specific problems\nfacing men who were affected by depression. It included advice for those\naffected, and stated that individuals could contact mental health charity Mind\nfor “advice and support”. \n3. The complainant said that Mind only operated in\nEngland and Wales and would therefore be unable to offer advice to individuals\nin Northern Ireland. \n4. The newspaper said that the article had been based on\ncopy provided by an agency which operated across the United Kingdom, and had\nbeen published in good faith. On receipt of the complaint, the reporter had\ncontacted Mind to clarify the matter. Mind had indicated that it was able to\noffer “information and help” to people within Northern Ireland. The newspaper\nhad subsequently accepted that this help would take the form of a referral to\nthe relevant local services, as Mind itself did not operate within Northern\nIreland. In light of this, it offered to publish the following clarification on\nthe matter: \nAn article about depression among men (‘Why it’s time to\nman up about the problem of depression’, Life December 1, 2014) should have\nincluded local helpline numbers for people affected by the issues involved.\nThey are: Samaritans 08457 909090 and Lifeline 0808 808 8000. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 1 (Accuracy) \ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information, including pictures. \nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand – where appropriate – an apology published. \nFindings of the Committee\n6. The newspaper had obtained the copy from an agency,\nand published it in good faith. There had been no failure to take care not to\npublish inaccurate or misleading information in breach of Clause 1 (i). Whilst\nit was accepted that Mind does not operate a helpline service within Northern\nIreland, it was not in dispute that the charity would offer information and\nhelp to callers from outside of England and Wales, in advising them of the\ntelephone numbers of relevant local organisations. As such, the article’s\nreference to the charity as a source of advice and support was not\nsignificantly misleading such that a correction was required in line with the\nterms of Clause 1 (ii). There was no breach of Clause 1. Nonetheless, the\nnewspaper’s offer of clarification was welcome. \nConclusions\n7. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 20/01/2015\nDate decision issued: 15/04/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
