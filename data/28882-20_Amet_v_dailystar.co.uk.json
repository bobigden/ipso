In circumstances where the Committee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require the publication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement of which is determined by IPSO. 43. The Committee considered that the publication did not take the necessary care when reporting that the complainant had stated that chicken nuggets could “help cure” and alleviate autism. The Committee considered that the appropriate remedy was the publication of a correction to put the correct position on record. A correction was considered to be sufficient, as the claim was not the central point of the article, which reported on the full recommendations provided by the complainant in the video consultation, and the publication had promptly offered a correction to address the claims that had been found to be inaccurate, notwithstanding the Committee’s finding that the wording offered was not sufficient to address the inaccuracies fully. 44. The Committee then considered the placement of this correction. This correction should be added to the article and appear as a standalone correction in the online corrections and clarifications column, as the wording which required correction had appeared in the headline. This wording of the correction should only include information required to identify the inaccuracies and provide the correct position: that the complainant had not stated that chicken nuggets could “help cure” autism, and that chicken nuggets had been referenced based on the specific case study presented to the complainant and as part of a wider meal plan. The wording should also be agreed with IPSO in advance and should make clear that it has been published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards Organisation. If the publication intends to continue to publish the online article without amendment, the correction should be published beneath the headline. If the article is amended, the correction should be published as a footnote which explains the amendments that have been made.   Date complaint received: 02/11/2020",
    "text": "\n\n\n\n\n\nDecision of the Complaints Committee – 28882-20\nAmet v dailystar.co.uk\nSummary of Complaint\n1. Lorene Amet complained to the\nIndependent Press Standards Organisation that dailystar.co.uk breached Clause 1\n(Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy) and Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and\nsubterfuge) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Brit\ndoctor claims 'vaccine causes autism' and 'chicken nuggets can help cure it'”,\npublished on 3 November 2020.\n2. The article reported on an investigation\ninto an autism specialist. The article reported how an investigator “went\nundercover” to have a video consultation with the specialist. It said that\nthere was a “probe after worried parents complained about a treatment for\nautistic children”. The article contained a still image of the specialist taken\nfrom the video consultation.\n3. The article claimed that the specialist\nhad said that the child’s diet could solve her “challenging behavioural issues”\nand that “organic chicken nuggets” could alleviate autism and “help cure it”\nand that the specialist had sent the investigator “vegan recipes” as part of\nthe consultation. It also stated that the specialist had suggested that the MMR\nvaccine was linked to autism. The article contained a quote from a named doctor\nwho said it was “disgraceful” that private practitioners misinform patients.\nThe article said that the investigator had been sent an email with the tagline\n“Autism is treatable”. The article also said that the specialist had\nrecommended various tests and anti-inflammatories for the child and that\n“further ‘treatment’ would involve working with other doctors in Geneva.”\n4. The complainant was the specialist\nreferred to in the article. She said that the article had breached Clause 10 of\nthe Editors’ Code as the video consultation had been recorded and an image had\nbeen taken of her without her knowledge with a clandestine device. She said\nthat the investigator had engaged in subterfuge by inventing a child and by\nconcealing the fact she was working for a newspaper in order to arrange the\nsession. The complainant said that the article was not in the public interest,\nas the allegations against her were false and the article was inaccurate. She\nalso said that the investigator had an undisclosed conflict of interest as: she\nworked as an activist for a company whose work focused on people with autism;\nshe had worked with the press previously and had been paid for this work; and\nshe believed the investigator and journalist were biased against her.\n5. The complainant also said the article\nwas inaccurate in breach of Clause 1. She said that she had not said that the\nchild’s diet could solve her “challenging behavioural issues”, nor that\n“organic chicken nuggets” could alleviate or “help cure” autism. She said that\nin fact she had recommended a self-restrictive diet overall, and that chicken\nnuggets were simply an example of how a food that the specific case had been\nsaid to consume previously and which could be made with healthy ingredients and\nless inflammatory food, in line with this diet. She also said that it was a\ncontradiction within the article to state she recommended both “chicken\nnuggets” and “vegan” recipes.\n6. The complainant said it was inaccurate\nto report that the probe was triggered after a parent raised concerns about the\ncomplainant. The complainant said she was not aware of such concerns, nor did\nshe think such a parent would have contacted the publication.\n7. The complainant also said it was\ninaccurate to report that she had suggested that the MMR vaccine is linked to\nautism, as she had never said this, and that she had mentioned other possible\nfactors that may have contributed to the child’s autism. She also said that it\nwas the investigator who had repeatedly brought up the MMR vaccine and asked\nher whether there was a link.  \n8. The complainant said it was misleading\nto include the quote from a named doctor as she disputed that she had made the\ncomments in the article, and it was therefore inaccurate to report the quote\nthat had been supplied on this basis.\n9. The article claimed that the\ninvestigator was sent an email with the tagline “Autism is treatable”. The\ncomplainant said she did not send an email with this tagline. She supplied both\nthe email sent and a questionnaire she intended the investigator to answer, which\ndid not have this tagline. The investigator had also sent the complainant\nscreenshots of the survey she had completed, which the complainant provided and\nwhich did not contain the tagline “Autism is treatable”. She accepted that the\nthird-party website that this questionnaire came from used the tagline “Autism\nis treatable” but noted that she did not send a document with this tagline\npersonally.\n10. The complainant said it was misleading\nto report that she had recommended various tests and “anti-inflammatories”. She\nsaid that in fact, after the investigator asked what testing was available, she\nmade her aware of such tests in response to her request. She said she also made\nclear there were no benefits to testing, and that therefore she could not be described\nas having “recommended” tests. The complainant also said she did not recommend\n“anti-inflammatories”, but a diet that was anti-inflammatory in nature. She\nsaid that as she did not recommend such consultations or tests, it was\ninaccurate to report that “further ‘treatment’ would involve working with other\ndoctors in Geneva.”\n11. The complainant also said that the\narticle breached Clause 2 (Privacy), as it included a screenshot of the video\nconsultation showing her face, in her home where she worked.\n12. The publication did not accept a breach\nof the Code. It accepted that Clause 10 was engaged, but said that there was\nsufficient public interest to justify the investigator’s actions. It said that\na source made the publication aware of the complainant's firm and that a\nfurther source told it the complainant's firm had been mentioned to them by\nconcerned parents in the course of their work campaigning for government\nregulation over unproven autism treatments. The publication then commissioned\nan investigator it had worked with previously to pursue the story. The\npublication said that, prior to engaging in the subterfuge, there was a\ndiscussion with the editor as to what information would be collected, the means\nof collecting it, and whether it was in the public interest.\n13. The publication stated that no other\nmethods had been used to obtain the complainant’s views; however, the\nmisrepresentation and subterfuge was proportionate, and had to be used in this\ncase in order to see how the complainant engaged with a potential client,\nrather than a newspaper. It said that a video consultation was the usual\npractice in the complainant’s booking process and therefore it used this method\nas it was not aware of a way to receive a similar result with a lower level of\nsubterfuge, a less intrusive method, or no clandestine device.\n14. The publication also stated that the\ninvestigation was in the public interest on the grounds that it would help\nprotect public health and safety, and would protect the public from being\nmisled by an action or statement of an individual or organisation. The\npublication also said that previous investigations had found that the\ncomplainant did not disclose that her doctorate was not medical. It also stated\nthat if parents are paying or considering paying for the therapy on the\nunderstanding that this is a legitimate 'medical' treatment, then they were\npotentially being exploited and the general public need to be made aware.\n15. With regards to the accuracy of the\narticle, the publication provided a transcript of the recording, and shortly\nafterwards the audio recording of the meeting. The complainant subsequently\nmade amendments to the transcript, which were accepted by the publication.\n16. The publication referred to a section\nof the transcript which stated the following:\nComplainant: Number one is the diet – the\ndiet, we have to change it. It is almost certain that your daughter is in pain\nand that’s why she wakes up. This is in part because of the diet.\n[...]\nComplainant: Well as I said, we remove the\nfood which are pro-inflammatory. These foods contribute to maintaining\ninflammation. The inflammation could have been triggered by the genetics or the\nvaccine but it is maintained. She is displaying issues of health because of a\nsudden onset of challenging behavioural and self injurious behaviour; she is in\npain. Until you change the diet, that pain will not stop. There is no magic\npill in autism. Zero. I cannot give you one pill which will take it away.\nThe publication therefore said it was not\ninaccurate to report that the complainant had said that the child’s diet could\nbe solve her “challenging behavioural issues”. It added that the article as a\nwhole made clear that the complainant’s advice was change to the child’s diet\nin general, but stated that the complainant went into a lot of detail regarding\na recipe for organic chicken nuggets. It said where the complainant had said\nthat “number one is diet” and that “this is in part because of the diet” and\nthat she stated in another part of the transcript that children had “fully\nrecovered” from her plan, it was not misleading to report that she had said\nthat organic chicken nuggets could alleviate or cure autism. Whilst it did not\naccept a breach of Clause 1, the publication offered to publish the following\nas a footnote to the article:\nWe are happy to make clear Dr Amet's\nsuggestion of removing gluten from home-made chicken nuggets is part of her\nwider diet plan, to help people with autism. Always seek medical advice before\nstarting any new treatment or diet.\n17. The publication said that where many of\nthe recipes supplied by the complainant were vegan, it was not inaccurate to\nreport that she had recommended “vegan recipes”.\n18. The publication stated that the\ncomplainant not being aware of the concerns being raised by parents was not a\nbreach of Clause 1. It reiterated that this was an important factor for the\npublication’s investigation.\n19. The publication stated that the\ncomplainant had linked the MMR vaccine to autism. It supplied the following\npassage from the transcript:\nComplainant: Yes,…basically, as you know\nthe NHS and the official position is there’s no link between vaccination and\nit.\n[…] There’s been quite a number of studies\nwhich have suggested otherwise and of course, quite a lot of the opinion has\nbeen suppressed and people have been attacked for questioning the safety of\nvaccination, especially MMR.\n[…]\nAs far as I’m concerned I have heard the story\nyou are sharing, over and over - I have no doubt there are children who are\naffected by this. It actually fits very well with what we understand autism for\nsome children to be. The animal model where you mimic infections when you\nbasically cause a burdening of the immune system and vaccination is a means to\ncause the system to be overwhelmed. That causes inflammation, this affects\nbrain function. This can link to gut issues, this can link to behaviour And\nunfortunately sometimes these changes are essentially irreversible.\nInvestigator: It’s terrible they’ve been\ngetting away from it for so long.\nComplainant: Yes, it is terrible. I remain\n- I don’t remain hopeful - but I believe eventually it will be accepted. I\nbelieve it will be. It only needs the right person in the right place -a\npresident whose child has the same issue could completely change the whole\nthing and completely stop it. One person alone in the right place a the right\ntime could do that but at the moment all scientists, all doctors, who have\nraised their concern have been attacked. Basically you can’t do anything. Even\ndoctors do not do their job because normally when there is an adverse reaction\nyou have to complete a form which is called a yellow card to flag the adverse\nreaction to this. But they don’t do this because they say oh no, there is no\nlink - therefore they’re not even reporting it, saying autism is starting off\nat 18 months of age, it’s just a coincidence. But the reality is we have\nchildren who have been given the vaccination earlier than planned and they’ve\ndevvloped the signs of autism at eight months , we equally have children who\nreceive the vaccination much later, even age of eight, and they develop sign of\nautism at that point. And that doesn’t fit with the textbook description of\nautism and when you develop it.\n15. The publication provided the emails\nthat had been sent to experts, and the response of the doctor named in the\narticle, which included the quote that was reported. It also stated that two\nother experts had commented, but had asked to remain anonymous.\n20. The publication said that the\ninvestigator had been sent links to two forms to complete with questions about\nher daughter ahead of the meeting. One of the questionnaires that was sent to\nthe investigator was from a website which used the tagline 'Autism is\nTreatable'. It said it was not significantly inaccurate to report that this was\na tagline to the email, rather than to a form linked to by an email. It changed\nthe article to state that it was a tagline to a questionnaire, rather than an\nemail, but did not offer a correction on this point.\n21. The publication did not accept that the\ncomplainant had not recommended tests and anti-inflammatories. It acknowledged\nthat the complainant had initially advised that “before investing in tests I\nwould suggest you would start with the diet” but said that the complainant had\nsaid that the child should “go on to” anti-inflammatory supplements straight\naway. The complainant also explained that there were multiple tests that could\nbe done at home in order to assess the patient’s health.\nThe publication noted that after the\nsession, the complainant sent a document describing tests she would\n“recommend”, which gave information on blood, urine, hair and stool tests, the\ntotal cost of which was £971.90. The publication also noted that during the\ninterview, the complainant had said she worked with medical doctors who worked\nin Geneva.\n22. The publication did not accept that the\nuse of the image of the complainant in the article breached Clause 2 (Privacy).\nIt said the image simply showed her likeness and there was no information\nincluded in respect of which the complainant had a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. The publication also said that the use of the image was justified as\nit demonstrated that the investigation had taken place. It also said that in any\ncase, there is a strong public interest in relation to protecting public health\nand safety and preventing the public from being misled by some statement or\naction of that individual.\n23. The complainant said that the offered\ncorrection did not resolve her complaint, as she did not suggest removing\ngluten from homemade chicken nuggets or a wider diet plan “to help people with\nautism”, but in order to help the specific case of the fictitious child\npresented to her by the investigator. The complainant noted that she had been\ntold the child ate chicken nuggets every day with no fruit or vegetables, and\nthat she had only offered chicken nuggets as tailored to this individual.\n24. After reviewing the email that was sent\nto the expert by the publication seeking a comment for inclusion in the\narticles, the complainant said it contained multiple inaccuracies. She said\nthat the quote from the expert was, therefore, gained on false pretences, and\nconsequently that it was misleading to include the expert’s comments in the\narticle. The email from the publication included the following information: it\nsaid the complainant had “insisted” and had “no doubt” the MMR jab was linked\nto autism, which the complainant disputed; it said she had recommended\n“anti-inflammatories” would help the child, which she said  gave the appearance that she had recommended\ndrugs, when in fact she had recommended supplements with anti-inflammatory\nproperties and an anti-inflammatory diet; it stated “given that parents may be\ntaken in by claims and persuaded to spend a lot under the belief their child's\nautism can be 'treated'”, which the complainant said was inaccurate as she did\nnot persuade parents who were free to choose what care they thought would be\nhelpful to them and she did not “make claims”; it referred to “concern about\nunregulated private clinics in general”, which the complainant said was\nmisleading as she was not required to register with a regulatory body; it did\nnot list all of the recipes sent and only set out a few, describing them as\n“vegan” recipes; it referred to the National Institute of Health Care and\nExcellence discrediting exclusion diets; it said that the complainant had\nblamed the child’s behaviour on her diet which caused her to be “in pain”,\nwhich the complainant said was not accurate and omitted that she had also\nrecommended laboratory testing for the further health causes.\n25. The publication did not accept that the\nemail sent to the expert was inaccurate. It said that the allegations\nspecifically about the complainant were accurate, for the reasons previously\ncited, and that it was not inaccurate to describe nutritional supplements with\nanti-inflammatory benefits as “anti-inflammatories”.  It said that the reference to parents being\n“taken in by claims and persuaded to spend a lot under the belief their child's\nautism can be 'treated'” and “unregulated clinics” was context for the expert\nand more general rather than being specifically about the complainant. It noted\nthe complainant was not named in the email.\nRelevant Code Provisions\nClause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish\ninaccurate, misleading or distorted information or images, including headlines\nnot supported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading\nstatement or distortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence,\nand — where appropriate — an apology published.

An exceptional public interest would\nneed to be demonstrated to over-ride the normally paramount interests of\nchildren under 16. \nFindings of the Committee\n26. The Editors’ Code makes clear that\nsubterfuge and misrepresentation can be justified in the public interest, which\nincludes protecting public health and safety. The Committee considered that the\ninvestigation into a practitioner who offers paid services to help children\nwith autism could be in the public interest as it was an issue which may concern\nthe protection of public health and safety. \n27. The publication had commissioned an\ninvestigator who had knowledge of the subject, who engaged in misrepresentation\nand subterfuge in order to create a fake persona to pose as a parent of an\nautistic child and participate in a video consultation. The Committee noted\nthat the complainant had concerns that the investigator was not impartial, but\nmade clear that this is not a question that fell under the Editors’ Code, or\nrelevant to the requirements under Clause 10.\n28. The newspaper said it had been\ncontacted by a source, and had been put in touch with a further source – both\nof whom wished to remain anonymous – who raised concerns about the\ncomplainant’s firm and the treatments which it recommended for autism. The\npublication also noted several parts of the complainant’s website which\nprovided advice which appeared to contradict NHS and the National Institute for\nHealth and Care Excellence guidelines and advice for autism. The newspaper had\ndemonstrated that it considered what information might be obtained from the use\nof clandestine devices and subterfuge in advance of the investigation, by\ndiscussing several questions with the editor. It had also considered the\nproportionality of the investigation, and it was reasonable for the journalist\nand newspaper to believe that they would be unable to ascertain the\ncomplainant’s usual advice for children with autism, without employing\nsubterfuge and misrepresentation. The Committee noted that a video consultation\nwas the complainant’s usual method of consulting potential clients, and that\nthe newspaper arranged a consultation by the same method. The use of\nmisrepresentation and subterfuge was justified in the public interest, in order\nto investigate whether the public might be being misled by the actions of the\ncomplainant. \n29. The publication considered that its\ninvestigation had demonstrated that the complainant had recommended exclusion\ndiets against NHS advice and the National Institute for Health and Care\nExcellence guidelines; that the complainant had suggested that there was a link\nbetween the MMR vaccine and autism; and that the complainant believed that\nstudies confirming a link between the two had been supressed. Where these views\nappeared to have been expressed by a health professional, the Committee\nconsidered that the material gathered during the investigation concerned the\nprotection of public health and safety and that its publication was justified\nin the public interest.\n30. The publication had appropriately and\nsatisfactorily considered the issues raised under the Code, prior both to the\ninvestigation and the publication of the information. The Committee found that\nthe newspaper had satisfied the requirements of the public interest section of\nthe Code; there was no breach of Clause 10.\n31. With regards to the accuracy of the\narticle, the headline stated that the complainant had said that chicken nuggets\ncould “help cure” autism and the body of the article reported that she had claimed\nthat child autism could be alleviated by an exclusion diet which includes\nchicken nuggets. For the purposes of the investigation, the publication had\ncreated a profile for a child who was said to predominantly eat chicken\nnuggets... The complainant had recommended a change of diet as part of her\nassessment and, on the basis of the specific case study that had been presented\nto her, had explained how a recipe for chicken nuggets could contribute to\nthis. It was a distortion to the extent of an inaccuracy to report that the\ncomplainant had said organic chicken nuggets would alleviate, or help cure,\nautism, when in fact the complainant had suggested a change of diet in general,\nand had referred to chicken nuggets in response to the particular profile she had\nbeen given. In addition, the complainant had made clear during the\ninvestigation that she believed there was “no cure” for autism, and it was\ntherefore inaccurate to report that she had said chicken nuggets could “help\ncure it”. The publication had not taken care not to publish inaccurate\ninformation on this point, and there was a breach of Clause 1(i). As this claim\nwas one of the factors used to discredit the complainant and appeared in the\nheadline, it was a significant inaccuracy requiring correction under Clause\n1(ii).\n32. The publication offered a correction in\nits first response to IPSO’s investigation, which was appropriately prompt in\nthe circumstances. However, the correction offered did not address the initial\ninaccuracy, that chicken nuggets had been discussed in the context of a\nspecific case study and that the complainant had not said that they would “help\ncure” autism. For this reason, the correction offered did not satisfy Clause\n1(ii) and there was a further breach of the Code.\n33. Where many of the recipes sent by the\ncomplainant to the investigator were vegan, it was not inaccurate to report\nthat the complainant had sent “vegan recipes”. There was no breach of Clause 1\non this point.\n34. The complainant said she doubted that a\nparent had raised concerns about her, as she was not aware of any parents\nhaving concerns, and did not believe that they would approach a newspaper about\nthem. Whilst it may have surprised the complainant that a parent had gone to\nthe newspaper with such concerns, this complaint was based on speculation\nalone, and the publication had a duty to protect its sources under Clause 14.\nThere were no grounds for the Committee to support a breach of Clause 1 on this\npoint.\n35. The complainant said she had never\nsuggested that the MMR vaccine was linked to autism. However, the complainant\naccepted the accuracy of the transcript as detailed in paragraph 19 of this\ndecision. The Committee considered that the complainant’s position as recorded\nin the agreed transcript of the meeting, as quoted above, could accurately be\ncharacterised as the complainant suggesting a link between autism and the MMR\nvaccine. The fact that the investigator had asked questions specifically about\nthis did not make reporting the complainant’s response misleading. There was no\nbreach of Clause 1 on these points.\n36. The complainant accepted that the\nthird-party website she used for questionnaires contained a tagline stating,\n“Autism is treatable”. In addition, the Committee noted that whilst the\ncomplainant had said that there is no “cure” or “treatment” for autism, the\nname of her company was “Autism Treatment Plus”. Where the complainant accepted\nthat the third-party website used this tagline, and that the investigator had\nbeen sent a questionnaire from this website, it was not significantly\ninaccurate to report that the investigator had been sent an email with the\ntagline “autism is treatable”. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n37. The complainant accepted that the\nthird-party website she used for questionnaires contained a tagline that stated\n“autism is treatable”. The link to the third party website was included in the\nquestionnaire sent to the investigator. In addition, the Committee noted that\nwhilst the complainant had said that there is no “cure” or “treatment” for\nautism, the name of her company was “Autism Treatment Plus”. The publication\nappeared to acknowledge that the email did not carry the tagline. Nonetheless,\nwhere the third-party website linked to in the questionnaire emailed to the\ninvestigator used this tagline and the complainant’s company name referred to\n“Autism Treatment”, it was not significantly inaccurate to report that the\ninvestigator had been sent a questionnaire with the tagline “autism is\ntreatable”. There was no breach of Clause 1 on this point.\n38. The complainant accepted that she had\nsaid “We will need to assess the full extent of your daughters’ health through\nlaboratory testing” and had then sent a document to the investigator after the\nsession which stated “I enclose below some information below on the tests we\nrecommend”. The complainant had also accepted that the tests would be analysed,\nand prescriptions would be made by doctors in Geneva. On this basis, it was not\nmisleading for the article to report that the complainant had recommended\ntests, or that treatment would involve working with “medics in Geneva”. In\naddition, the Committee found that it was not significantly inaccurate to\ndescribe supplements with anti-inflammatory properties as “anti-inflammatories”.  There was no breach of Clause 1 on these\npoints.\n39. For the reasons given above, the\nCommittee found that the email which had been sent by the publication to the\nexpert, which contained the same allegations as within the article, was not\ninaccurate. It was, therefore, not inaccurate to include the quote provided by\nthe expert in the article in response to the allegations. There was no breach\nof Clause 1 on this point.\n40. The Committee noted that the image of\nthe complainant used in the article was taken through a video platform whilst\nshe was in her home  and was taken\nwithout the complainant’s consent or knowledge. However, it noted that it was\ntaken whilst the complainant was acting in her professional capacity, and\nprovided a view of her that she openly shared with her clients and potential\nclients without restrictions, through her video consultations. In such\ncircumstances, the Committee considered that the complainant did not have the\nsame expectation of privacy as someone’s home would normally afford. In\naddition, the Committee noted that the image had been published to demonstrate\nthat the investigation had taken place. \nIn all the circumstances, the Committee did not find that the\npublication of the image intruded into the complainant’s private life, and there\nwas no breach of Clause 2.\nConclusion(s)\n41. The complaint was partly upheld under\nClause 1.\nRemedial Action Required\n42. Having upheld a breach of Clause 1, the\nCommittee considered what remedial action should be required. In circumstances\nwhere the Committee establishes a breach of the Editors’ Code, it can require\nthe publication of a correction and/or an adjudication, the terms and placement\nof which is determined by IPSO.\n43. The Committee considered that the\npublication did not take the necessary care when reporting that the complainant\nhad stated that chicken nuggets could “help cure” and alleviate autism. The\nCommittee considered that the appropriate remedy was the publication of a\ncorrection to put the correct position on record. A correction was considered\nto be sufficient, as the claim was not the central point of the article, which\nreported on the full recommendations provided by the complainant in the video\nconsultation, and the publication had promptly offered a correction to address\nthe claims that had been found to be inaccurate, notwithstanding the\nCommittee’s finding that the wording offered was not sufficient to address the\ninaccuracies fully.\n44. The Committee then considered the\nplacement of this correction. This correction should be added to the article\nand appear as a standalone correction in the online corrections and\nclarifications column, as the wording which required correction had appeared in\nthe headline. This wording of the correction should only include information\nrequired to identify the inaccuracies and provide the correct position: that\nthe complainant had not stated that chicken nuggets could “help cure” autism,\nand that chicken nuggets had been referenced based on the specific case study\npresented to the complainant and as part of a wider meal plan. The wording\nshould also be agreed with IPSO in advance and should make clear that it has\nbeen published following an upheld ruling by the Independent Press Standards\nOrganisation. If the publication intends to continue to publish the online\narticle without amendment, the correction should be published beneath the\nheadline. If the article is amended, the correction should be published as a\nfootnote which explains the amendments that have been made. \n\nDate complaint received: 02/11/2020\nDate decision issued:\n21/09/2021\n\n\n\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer\nThe complainant complained to the\nIndependent Complaints Reviewer about the process followed by IPSO in handling\nthis complaint. The Independent Complaints Reviewer decided that the process\nwas not flawed and did not uphold the request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
