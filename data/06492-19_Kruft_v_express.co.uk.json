Michael Kruft complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that express.co.uk breached Clause 1 (Accuracy) of the\nEditors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Brexit betrayal: Johnson\nlaunches ruthless bid to ORDER rebel John Bercow’s departure”, published on 4\nSeptember 2019.\n2. The article reported on the Conservative Party’s plan to\nreplace the Speaker by fielding an alternative candidate for election in his\nconstituency. Its headline stated that “Johnson launches ruthless bid to ORDER\nrebel John Bercow’s departure” and the text of the article also claimed that\n“Mr Hammond was, however, removed from Parliament after Mr Johnson became Prime\nMinister.”\n3. The complainant said that the article was inaccurate as\nthe Prime Minister cannot order the removal of the Speaker. He also said that\nit was inaccurate to report that Mr Hammond was removed from Parliament, as he\nsaid that he was actually sacked from the Government Cabinet.\n4. The publication accepted that the article had contained\ninaccuracies. Upon receipt of the complaint the publication amended the\nheadline to: “Brexit betrayal: Johnson launches ruthless bid to replace rebel\nJohn Bercow’s departure” and the reference to Mr Hammond being removed from\nParliament was deleted. The publication also added the following clarifying\nfootnote during the referral period:\nA previous version of this article reported that Mr Johnson\nwas planning a bid to \"order rebel John Bercow's departure\". The\nPrime Minister, however can not order the removal of the Speaker of the House.\nThe article also stated, that \"Mr Hammond was, however,\nremoved from Parliament after Mr Johnson became Prime Minister.\" In fact,\nMr Hammond was sacked from the Government Cabinet, not removed from Parliament.\nWe are happy to clarify this. \n5. During IPSO’s investigation, the publication was made\naware that Mr Hammond was not sacked from Parliament, as stated in the\ncorrective footnote, but had in fact resigned. It amended the correction within\na day of receiving this information so that it read:\nA previous version of this article reported that Mr Johnson\nwas planning a bid to \"order rebel John Bercow's departure\". The\nPrime Minister, however can not order the removal of the Speaker of the House.\nThe article also stated that \"Mr Hammond was, however,\nremoved from Parliament after Mr Johnson became Prime Minister.\" In fact,\nMr Hammond resigned from the Government Cabinet, and was not removed from\nParliament. We are happy to clarify this.”\n6. The complainant did not accept the offer of resolution.\nHe said this was not prominent enough and wanted a standalone article.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n7. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nFindings of the Committee\n8. It was accepted by the publication that it was inaccurate\nto report that the Prime Minister planned to order the Speaker’s departure and\nthat Mr Hammond had been removed from Parliament; it said that these\ninaccuracies had been published due to human error. This represented a failure\nto take care not to publish inaccurate information in breach of Clause 1(i). Reporting\nthat the Prime Minister could order that the Speaker leave his office and that\nthe former Chancellor of the Exchequer had been removed from parliament\nrepresented significant inaccuracies which required correction under the terms\nof Clause 1(ii).\n9. The publication accepted that the article was inaccurate\nand amended it within a week of receiving the complaint and added a clarifying\nfootnote. During IPSO’s investigation, the publication had been made aware of\nan inaccuracy within their correction and this was amended this within a day.\nThe Committee considered that the wording identified the inaccuracies, set out\nthe correct position and was offered promptly. Further, the Committee\nconsidered that the clarifying footnote represented due prominence, as it was\nclearly visible in the article. Therefore the Committee found that there was no\nbreach of Clause 1(ii).\nConclusion\n10. The complaint was upheld under Clause 1(i).\nRemedial Action\n11. The Committee found that the correction previously\noffered by the publication was sufficient to correct the significant\ninaccuracies and no further action needed to be taken.\n \nDate complaint received: 04/09/2019\nDate decision issued: 15/01/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
