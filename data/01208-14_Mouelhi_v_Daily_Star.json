Mesbeh Mouelhi complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Daily Star had breached Clause 3 (Privacy) and\nClause 12 (Discrimination) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article\nheadlined “Benefits mum blows £18,000 on toyboy rat”, published on 31 July\n2014. \n2. The article told the story of the complainant’s partner’s\nformer husband, to whom she said she had given her life savings before deciding\nto seek a divorce. At the time of publication she had entered into a new\nrelationship with the complainant, and the article noted that both men were\nyoung and Tunisian. \n3. The complainant said that the newspaper had published\nphotographs of him without his consent, and he had not given permission for his\npersonal details to be published. He said that this breached Clause 3. He also\nsaid that the article had prompted people to criticise him, but did not explain\nfurther why this constituted a breach of Clause 12. \n4. The newspaper said that the picture of the complainant\nand his partner had been provided by his partner. It said that the newspaper\nhad not taken the photograph, and it had not been taken without the\ncomplainant’s permission. It said that it understood that the complainant’s\npartner had previously posted the photograph on her Facebook page. It said that\nthe complainant could not have had a reasonable expectation that the photograph\nwould remain private, and it did not reveal any private information about him.\nIt said that the Code did not prohibit the reporting of a person’s nationality,\nand it did not believe that the article raised a breach of Clause 12. \nRelevant Code Provisions\n5. Clause 3 (Privacy) \ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including pictures. \nClause 12 (Discrimination) \ni) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference\nto an individual’s race, colour, religion, gender, sexual orientation or to any\nphysical or mental illness or disability. \nii) Details of an individual’s race, colour, religion,\nsexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be avoided\nunless genuinely relevant to the story. \nFindings of the Committee\n6. The article under complaint was the story of the\ncomplainant’s partner’s relationships. She was entitled to tell her story, in\naccordance with her right to freedom of expression. While the Committee\nacknowledged the complainant’s concern about the inclusion of details which he\nconsidered to be personal, in light of the nature of the information and the\nfact that it had been provided to the newspaper by his partner, the Committee\nconcluded that the publication of this information did not raise a breach of\nClause 3. \n7. The complainant’s partner had provided the photograph of\nthe complainant to the newspaper, and she had been remunerated for its use; it\nhad not been obtained in a way which intruded into his privacy. Further, it did\nnot reveal any information about him which would be considered private under\nthe terms of Clause 3. There was no breach of Clause 3. \n8. While it was regrettable that the complainant had\nreceived criticism following publication of the article, this would not in\nitself engage the terms of Clause 12. \nConclusions\n9. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A \nDate complaint received: 07/10/2014 \nDate decision issued: 20/02/2015\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
