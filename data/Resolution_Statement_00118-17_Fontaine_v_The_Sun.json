The article was also published online\nwith the headline “CLEAVER LAG’S OFFENCES HUSHED”.2. The\narticle reported that the complainant had been struck off The Health and Care\nProfessions Council Register on the grounds of misconduct. It reported that the\ndisciplinary hearing had heard that the complainant had “violence erased from a\ntroubled man’s records to get him into a care home- where he went on to attack\nresidents with a meat cleaver”. The online article reported that “the Panel\nwere informed these events did not form part of the HCPC’s allegations and did\nnot allege that the actions of Mrs Fontaine caused the male to do these\nactions”.3. The\ncomplainant expressed concern that the newspaper had inaccurately reported that\nthe male had attacked fellow residents at the care home, when in fact the\nincident had taken place away from the residential home. The complainant said\nthat a journalist from a news agency had contacted her on her mobile phone for\ncomment; she expressed concern regarding how her number had been obtained.4. The\nnewspaper did not accept a breach of the Code. It said that the article was a\nfair and accurate report of the Health and Care Professions Council hearing.\nWhilst the newspaper amended the article and changed the words ‘fellow\nresidents’ to “two members of the public”, it said that the location of the\nincident did not affect the main focus of the article, which was a report on\nthe complainant’s removal from the HCPC Register. It said that the newsagency\nhad obtained the complainant’s mobile phone number from a publicly available\nsearch agency.Relevant Code provisions5. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.Clause 2 (Privacy)i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.Clause 14 Confidential sourcesJournalists have a moral obligation to protect confidential\nsources of information.Mediated outcome6. The\ncomplaint was not resolved through direct correspondence between the parties.\nIPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter.7. During\nIPSO’s investigation of the complaint, the newspaper offered to publish the\nfollowing footnote on the online article:An earlier version of this article reported that the\nindividual concerned attacked fellow residents at the care home. In fact, the\nvictims were not residents at the care home at the time of the incident.8. The\ncomplainant said this would resolve her complaint to her satisfaction.9. As the\ncomplaint was successfully mediated, the Complaints Committee did not make a\ndetermination as to whether there had been any breach of the Code.Date complaint received: 06/01/2017Date complaint concluded: 07/04/2017  \nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
