Robert\nGranger complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation that The\nScottish Sun on Sunday breached Clause 1 (Accuracy), Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause\n3 (Harassment), Clause 10 (Clandestine devices and subterfuge) and Clause 12\n(Discrimination) of the Editors' Code of Practice in an article headlined\n”Hollywood Stars & The Gun Crook”, published on 20 November 2016. The\narticle was also published online with the headline “MOVIE LACKEY'S SINISTER\nPAST Hollywood stars Glenn Close and Christian Slater and the Glasgow gun\ncrook”.\n2. The\narticle reported that a number of Hollywood “stars” were being looked after by\na “gun crook” while filming in Scotland. It said that the complainant, who in\n1996 had been “busted with revolvers and an ammo stash in a gangland cop\nsting”, had daily face-to-face dealings with the actors in the movie in his\nrole as a “roadie”. It quoted a source who said “Robert is open about his past\nand shows no remorse”, and “he thinks he’s a hard man. The less experienced\nguys are quite intimidated by him”. It said that the complainant was imprisoned\nfor four years in 1997 for the offence. The article included comment from the\ncomplainant, who explained that he was asked to collect a package contained the\nguns by somebody he owed money to.\n3. The\ncomplainant said that his privacy had been breached by reporting details of his\nconviction from 20 years ago. While he initially said that his conviction was\nspent under the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act, he subsequently accepted that\nthis was not the case.\n4. He said\nthat prior to publication of the article, two reporters from the newspaper\napproached him at his kitchen window, and asked him whether the actors involved\nin the movie knew about his past. He said that he told them to “fuck off” and\nclosed the window. He said that they then started to buzz the intercom until he\nwent outside and asked them to leave again. He said that the pair persisted\nwith questions and he made a third request for them to leave, which they\nadhered to. He said that the newspaper had taken photographs of him with hidden\ncameras on a closed, private film set.\n5. The\ncomplainant also said that it was inaccurate to suggest that he was a “hard\nman”. \n6. The\nnewspaper said that the complainant’s conviction was not spent under the terms\nof the Rehabilitation of Offenders Act in Scotland, which states that any\nconviction resulting in a sentence of three years or more imprisonment is never\nspent. It also said that reporting his conviction did not represent an intrusion\ninto the complainant’s privacy because the people he was working for, and with,\nhad a right to know about it; it said it was in the public interest to publish\ndetails of this.\n7. The\nnewspaper denied that the complainant had been harassed. It said that all\napproaches were conducted in a professional and polite manner, and provided a\nrecording of the conversation that took place between the complainant and its\nreporter. It said that the recording demonstrated that the complainant spoke at\nlength to the newspaper’s reporter at his kitchen window. It denied that the\ncomplainant ever told the reporter to “fuck off”, and said that the reporter\ndid not press the buzzer after the conversation had ended. It also said that\nthe complainant gave the reporter his phone number. It also said that the\nphotographs of the complainant at his work were taken from a public car park\nnext to a movie set, and while they had been taken discreetly, it denied that a\nhidden camera had been used.\n8. On\nlistening to the recording provided by the newspaper, the complainant accepted\nthat he had not recalled his conversation with the reporter accurately.\nHowever, he said that he had not known that he was being recorded, and said\nthat this represented a breach of Clause 10 of the Code. He also said, having\nlistened to the recording, that he clearly told the reporter that he had no\ncontact with the actors in the movie; however, he said that the article\nreported that he had contact with them every day. He also said that Clause 12\nhad been breached because the reporter had called him a “nutter”.\n9. The\nnewspaper denied that a clandestine recording device had been used. It said\nthat the reporter used a normal tape recorder as an aide memoire to back up his\nnotes. It also denied that Clause 12 was engaged in this instance. It said that\nthe tape recording was private, and was never published, nor intended to be\npublished, by the newspaper. It said that the complainant’s denial that he had\nface-to-face contact with the “stars” was in the original copy submitted, but\nhad been removed. In any event, it said that the article contained a quote from\nthe complainant’s manager where he confirmed that the complainant did not have\nany contact with the actors.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n10. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published.

The\nCommittee noted the complainant’s position that it was inaccurate to report\nthat he was a “hard man”. However, in light of his conviction, it did not\nconsider that it was significantly inaccurate for the article to characterise\nhim as it had; there was no breach of Clause 1.\n12. The\narticle quoted a source saying that the complainant had “face-to-face” dealings\nwith the actors; it also reported the position of the complainant’s manager\nthat he did not have any such contact with them. While the complainant had also\ndenied to the reporter that he had face-to-face dealings with the actors, the\nomission of this denial was not significantly misleading where the article made\nclear his manager’s denial on this point. There was no breach of Clause 1.\n13. The\ncomplainant’s offence was not spent under the terms of the Rehabilitation of\nOffenders Act in Scotland. Further, this conviction related to a serious\noffence for which he had received a substantial custodial sentence. As such,\nthis represented information that the complainant had no reasonable expectation\nof privacy in relation to. For these reasons, the reporting of his conviction\ndid not raise a breach of Clause 2.\n14. The complainant\nconceded that his recollection of the conversation with the reporter was\ninaccurate, and did not dispute the version of events put forward by the\nnewspaper. This version of the interaction between the complainant and reporter\ndid not raise any issues in relation to intimidation, harassment, or persistent\npursuit; there was no breach of Clause 3.\n15. The\ncomplainant did not dispute that the photographs published of him on the film\nset had been taken from a public carpark adjacent to the set, or that while the\nphotographs had been taken discreetly, they did not involve the use of hidden\ncameras or subterfuge. There was on breach of Clause 10 on this point.\n16. The\nreporter did not acquire any material using a clandestine listening device. The\ninterview with the complaint was conducted openly, and while he did not explain\nhe was recording the conversation for note-taking purposes, the reporter make\nclear who he was and the reason why he wished to speak to the complainant. In\nthis case, the use of the tape was a means of effectively recording the\ncomplainant’s comments. There was no misrepresentation or subterfuge, and no\nbreach of Clause 10.\n17. The\ncomplainant’s complaint under Clause 12 did not relate to published material,\nand did not therefore engage the terms of the Clause.\nConclusions\n18. The\ncomplaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\n19. N/A\nDate complaint received: 15/12/2016Date decision issued: 18/05/2017\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
