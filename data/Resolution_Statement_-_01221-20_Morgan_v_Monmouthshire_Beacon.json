Clive Morgan complained to the Independent Press\nStandards Organisation that the Monmouthshire Beacon breached Clause 1\n(Accuracy) of the Editors' Code of Practice in an article headlined “Residents\nclaim planning decision 'undemocratic'” published on 19 February 2019.\n2. The article reported that plans to build a new house in\nOsbaston had been approved by Monmouthshire County Council’s planning\ncommittee. It reported that this was “despite 60 objections from residents” and\n“Welsh Water’s own concerns with the development”.\n3. The complainant said that the statement that there was\n“60 objections from residents” was inaccurate as there were around 50\nobjections from 25 individual residents. The complainant also said that whilst\nWelsh Water submitted a letter as part of the planning process, they did not\nobject to the development.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n4. Clause 1 (Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator. \niii) A fair opportunity to reply to significant inaccuracies\nshould be given, when reasonably called for.\niv) The Press, while free to editorialise and campaign, must\ndistinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\nMediated Outcome\n5. The complaint was not resolved during the referral\nperiod. IPSO therefore began an investigation into the matter.\n6. During IPSO’s investigation, the publication offered to\npublish the following correction:\n“Our article, “Residents claim planning decision\n‘undemocratic’” (19 February 2020), reported that planning permission had been\napproved for a new house in Beaufort Road, Osbaston. It reported that the plans\nattracted “60 objections from residents”. In fact, there were around 50\nobjections from 25 individual residents. We also stated that Welsh Water had\nits “own concerns with the development.” We wish to make it clear that Welsh\nWater did not object to the application. We apologise for any distress that\nthis confusion has caused, and are happy to clarify.”\n7. The complainant said that this would resolve the matter\nto his satisfaction.\n8. As the complaint was successfully mediated, the\nComplaints Committee did not make a determination as to whether there had been\nany breach of the Code.\n \nDate complaint received: 27/02/2020\nDate complaint concluded by IPSO: 28/04/2020\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
