Ellie\nWarner, Nat Eddleston and his father, Nathaniel Eddleston complained to the\nIndependent Press Standards Organisation that mirror.co.uk breached Clause 2\n(Privacy), Clause 3 (Harassment) and Clause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nof the Editors’ Code of Practice in the articles headlined “Gogglebox Ellie's\nboyfriend crash pictures - devastating scenes as he 'fights for life'”,\npublished on 21 March 2022 and \"Gogglebox's Ellie Warner comforted by pals\nat pub in break from boyfriend's bedside\", published on 15 April 2022.\n2. The\nfirst article reported that Gogglebox star Ellie Warner’s boyfriend Nat\nEddleston had been hit by a car and was “fighting for his life”. It said that\nthe article was the “first look at the scene of [the] serious crash” and\ncontained a photograph of the car involved in the collision, taken after the\nincident; it showed the front windscreen had been smashed. The article also\nincluded a photograph of the crash scene at the time of the incident, which\nshowed several emergency service personnel attending Nat Eddleston on the floor\nafter the accident; his image had been pixelated.\n3. The\nsecond article reported that Ellie Warner had been seen being supported by\nfriends at a local pub after her boyfriend Nat Eddleston had been involved in a\ncar accident. It said that she had been seen for the first time since the\naccident and reported that “in pictures obtained by The Sun, the Channel 4 star\nwas seen wearing ripped jeans and a green military jacket” however the article\ndid not feature those specific pictures. The article included a number of other\nphotographs of Ellie Warner and Nat Eddleston.\n4. The\ncomplainants said that the first article breached Clause 2 and Clause 4 by\nincluding a photograph of the crash scene where Nat Eddleston was receiving\ntreatment. They considered this intruded into Nat Eddleston’s privacy and was\nan intrusion into the grief and shock of the family. The complainants said that\nthe photo showed Nat Eddleston moments after being hit by a car receiving\nlifesaving treatment, and regardless of the pixelation of this image, the\npublication of the image amounted to an intrusion at a very difficult time for\nNat Eddleston’s partner and family. They said that any individual who was\nunconscious and seriously injured had a reasonable expectation of privacy,\nwithout images of them being published in the press.\n5. The\ncomplainants said that the second article had also breached Clause 2 and Clause\n4. They said that the article included a photo of Ellie Warner which was taken\nwithout her knowledge on one of her first outings after the accident. It said\nthat by following her, photographing her, and publishing the photos, this\nbreached the terms of both Clauses.\n6. The\ncomplainants also said that there had been a breach of Clause 3. They said that\ntwo days after the accident, a journalist who identified themselves as working\nfor Mirror Online posted a letter through Nat Eddleston’s father’s (Nathaniel\nEddleston) door asking him for a comment and had parked outside his house. They\nsaid that he had found this upsetting and intrusive in breach of Clause 3. The\ncomplainants also added that the journalist spoke to neighbours.\n7. The\npublication apologised to the complainants for any distress or upset caused by\nthe story, but it did not consider there had been a breach of the Editor’s\nCode. It said that in regard to the photographs in the first article, the\nphotograph of Nat Eddleston receiving treatment had been provided by a member\nof the public who was present at the scene and care was taken by the\npublication to obscure the image of Nat Eddleston. It accepted that he had a\nreasonable expectation of privacy while receiving medical care but considered\nthat there was a public interest in publishing the image. The publication said\nthat it felt it was important to depict the scene in case any witnesses came\nforward, to highlight the shocking nature of the incident and added that at the\ntime of publication the perpetrator was still actively being looked for by the\npolice.\n8. The\nnewspaper said that any alleged breach of Clause 2 could be justified because\nof the public interest, specifically “detecting, or exposing crime, or the\nthreat of crime, or serious impropriety, and protecting public health and\nsafety”. The publication provided the police’s appeal for witnesses, which had\nbeen shared online and on social media on 19 March and said that the public\ninterest was considered prior to publication and as the police were actively\nappealing for witnesses, the editorial decision was made that it was important\nto include the image of the scene, with care taken to obscure the victim.\n9. The\npublication also said that Clause 4 of the Editors’ Code does not prohibit the\nreporting of distressing circumstances and events, but rather sets out that\npublication should be handled sensitively; it did not consider that there had\nbeen a breach of Clause 4 in this instance.\n10. In\nregard to the second article, the publication said that all the photographs\nincluded in the article were taken from public social media accounts and did\nnot represent a breach of Clause 2. The publication said that the article had\nnot been amended and the images the complainants were concerned about had not\nappeared in any version of the article.\n11. The\npublication further said that the single approach made to Nathaniel Eddleston\nby the letter posted through his door did not amount to a breach of Clause 3.\n12. The\ncomplainants said that the publication was mistaken that the police had still\nbeen looking for the “perpetrator” at the time of publication and at no time\nwere the police looking for the driver. It said that this negated the\npublication’s argument that the publishing of the picture had been in the\npublic interest.\nRelevant\nCode Provisions\nClause 2\n(Privacy)*\ni)\nEveryone is entitled to respect for their private and family life, home,\nphysical and mental health, and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii)\nEditors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private\nlife without consent. In considering an individual's reasonable expectation of\nprivacy, account will be taken of the complainant's own public disclosures of\ninformation and the extent to which the material complained about is already in\nthe public domain or will become so.\niii) It\nis unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their consent, in public or\nprivate places where there is a reasonable expectation of privacy.\nClause 3\n(Harassment)*\ni)\nJournalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment or persistent pursuit.\nii) They\nmust not persist in questioning, telephoning, pursuing or photographing\nindividuals once asked to desist; nor remain on property when asked to leave\nand must not follow them. If requested, they must identify themselves and whom\nthey represent.\niii)  Editors must ensure these principles are\nobserved by those working for them and take care not to use non-compliant\nmaterial from other sources.\nClause 4\n(Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn cases\ninvolving personal grief or shock, enquiries and approaches must be made with\nsympathy and discretion and publication handled sensitively. These provisions\nshould not restrict the right to report legal proceedings.\nThe\nPublic Interest (*)\nThere\nmay be exceptions to the clauses marked * where they can be demonstrated to be in\nthe public interest.\n1. The\npublic interest includes, but is not confined to:\n-\nDetecting or exposing crime, or the threat of crime, or serious impropriety.\n-\nProtecting public health or safety.\n- Protecting\nthe public from being misled by an action or statement of an individual or\norganisation.\n-\nDisclosing a person or organisation’s failure or likely failure to comply with\nany obligation to which they are subject.\n-\nDisclosing a miscarriage of justice.\n-\nRaising or contributing to a matter of public debate, including serious cases\nof impropriety, unethical conduct or incompetence concerning the public.\n-\nDisclosing concealment, or likely concealment, of any of the above.\n2. There\nis a public interest in freedom of expression itself.\n3. The\nregulator will consider the extent to which material is already in the public\ndomain or will become so.\n4.\nEditors invoking the public interest will need to demonstrate that they\nreasonably believed publication - or journalistic activity taken with a view to\npublication – would both serve, and be proportionate to, the public interest\nand explain how they reached that decision at the time.\n5. An\nexceptional public interest would need to be demonstrated to over-ride the\nnormally paramount interests of children under 16.\nFindings\nof the Committee\n13. The\ncomplainants considered that the inclusion of the photograph of the crash scene\nwhere Nat Eddleston was receiving treatment amounted to a breach of Clause 2.\nThe Committee appreciated that the publication of the photograph had caused the\ncomplainants distress at what was already a difficult time and expressed its\nsympathy for their circumstances. However, the Committee noted that the\nphotograph was very limited in detail, of a low resolution, and in practice\nshowed only a dark public street with two emergency service vehicles and\nvarious unidentifiable people with their faces obscured. Although the posture\nof two of the emergency service workers suggested that someone was on the\nground, a pixelated block at the bottom part of the image obscured what was\nhappening in that portion of the image. In its heavily pixelated form, and\ngiven the low image resolution and the time of night it was taken, the image\ndid not reveal any information about the injuries sustained or the treatment\nbeing received.  There was no breach of\nClause 2 regarding the publication of the image in the first article.\n14. The\nCommittee next considered the complainant’s concerns regarding Clause 4 in\nrelation to the photograph included in the first article. The Committee\nrecognised that the publication of the photograph was highly sensitive,\nparticularly so soon after the accident. However, in circumstances where the\narticle in which it was contained was a factual account of the accident; where\ncare had been taken to pixelate the image; and given the fact the image did not\nshow the injuries sustained or any treatment being received, the Committee\nconsidered that the publication of the photograph had been handled sensitively.\nWhile the image would have been upsetting for the complainants to see, the\nCommittee did not consider that its inclusion was insensitive. There was no breach\nof Clause 4 on this point.\n15. The\ncomplainants had also said that the second article was in breach of Clause 2\nand Clause 4; it said that the article included a photo of Ellie Warner which\nhad been taken without her knowledge on one of her first outings after the\naccident. The publication had said that all photographs included in the article\nwere from social media and that the image the complainants were concerned about\nhad not appeared in any version of the article. The Committee noted that the complainant\ndid not dispute that the photograph about which they were concerned had not\nappeared in the second article. Given this, there was no grounds for\ninvestigation under Clause 2 or Clause 4 on this point.\n16. The\ncomplainants had said that there had been a breach of Clause 3 as two days\nafter the accident a journalist who worked for the Mirror Online posted a\nletter through Nathaniel Eddleston’s door asking him if he would like to\ncomment on the incident. The Committee acknowledged that the complainants found\nthis upsetting given how soon after the incident the letter was sent; however,\none approach for comment through a polite letter did not amount to persistent\npursuit or questioning under the Clause. There was no breach of Clause 3.\nConclusion(s)\n17. The\ncomplaint was not upheld.\nRemedial\nAction Required\n18. N/A\n\n\n\nDate\ncomplaint received: 27/05/2022\nDate\ncomplaint concluded by IPSO: 09/11/2022\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
