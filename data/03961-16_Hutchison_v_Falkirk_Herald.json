The articles\nreported on a series of court appearances involving the complainant. The first\narticle reported that he was facing a charge of assault on his partner, and a\nfurther charge of sending a menacing letter to another woman. The second\narticle reported that the complainant had appeared in court and pleaded not\nguilty to the charge of assault on his partner, in which he was said to have “kicked\nher on the body and seized her by the neck with his hands”. The third article\nsaid that a judge had refused his request to lift bail conditions preventing\nhim seeing his partner. The final article reported that the complainant had\npleaded guilty to assaulting his partner, and had “burned a box of her\nunderwear before hitting her head off a wall”.\n3. The first\narticle was published online on 9 May 2016 with the headline “Ex soldier facing\ncharges against two women”; the fourth article was published online on 21 June\n2016 with the headline “Walter Mitty ex-soldier burned girlfriend’s underwear\nbefore attack”. Both articles were substantively similar to the versions that\nappeared in print. \n4. The complainant\nsaid that following his court appearance on 21 June, both he and his partner\nwere followed by the journalist who reported on his court case for the\npublication. He said that the journalist “chased him around the whole block”\noutside of court in attempt to take photographs of him and his partner. He said\nthat he quoted from the harassment clause of the Editors’ Code when he was\nfollowed by the journalist, but the journalist continued to take photographs.\nHe provided photographs of the journalist walking away from him and his\npartner. He also alleged that since his appearance in court, the newspaper had\nbeen “snooping around his house”.\n5. The complainant\nalso highlighted inaccuracies in the article. He said that it had not been\nmentioned in court that he had been charged with sending a menacing letter to\nanother woman, and in any event that charge had been dropped. He also denied\nthat it had been heard in court that he had kicked and punched his partner. He\nsaid it was inaccurate to report that there was underwear in the box that was\nset alight, although he did concede that he had set a box on fire, and it might\nhave contained a skirt.\n6. The newspaper\nsaid that the freelance journalist who attended the complainant’s hearing on 21\nJune took photographs of him after he left court, and provided the roll of\nthese photographs. It said that the journalist had wanted to get a photograph\nof the complainant’s partner, who it said was an integral part of the story,\nbecause he felt that the one he had taken of her on the steps of the court was\nnot sharp. It said that the journalist had followed the complainant and his\npartner for 80 metres in order to get a more usable photograph, and had taken\nthree further photographs over the course of four minutes. It said that the\njournalist did not hear either the complainant or his partner quote from the\nEditors’ Code. However, it said that as the journalist was taking his fourth\nphotograph, the complainant’s partner said something that he did not pick up,\nbut it might have been along the lines of “leave us be”. The journalist said\nthat he stopped taking photographs there and then. The newspaper emphasised\nthat it had not published any of the photographs taken by the journalist, and\ndenied that the journalist had ever visited the complainant’s home.\n7. The newspaper\nsaid that it had been mentioned in court that the complainant had set fire to a\nbox that was thought to contain underwear, and provided the reporter’s\nshorthand notes of the hearing. It said that the complainant’s original charge\nincluded detail that he kicked his partner and seized her by the neck, which it\nhad reported; however, when this allegation was dropped, this had been reported\nin the fourth article. It said that the charge of sending a menacing letter to\nanother woman was confirmed in court, but conceded that it may have been\ndropped. It said that it was happy to carry a piece confirming this.     \nRelevant Code Provisions\n8. Clause 1\n(Accuracy)\ni) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate,\nmisleading or distorted information or images, including headlines not\nsupported by the text.\nii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or\ndistortion must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and — where\nappropriate — an apology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence\nshould be as required by the regulator.\nClause 2 (Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\niii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without\ntheir consent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy.\nClause 3 (Harassment)\ni) Journalists must not engage in intimidation, harassment\nor persistent pursuit.\nii) They must not persist in questioning, telephoning,\npursuing or photographing individuals once asked to desist; nor remain on\nproperty when asked to leave and must not follow them. If requested, they must\nidentify themselves and whom they represent.\niii) Editors must ensure these principles are observed by\nthose working for them and take care not to use non-compliant material from\nother sources. \nClause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings.\nClause 12 (Discrimination)\ni) The press must avoid prejudicial or pejorative reference\nto an individual's, race, colour, religion, sex, gender identity, sexual\norientation or to any physical or mental illness or disability.\nii) Details of an individual's race, colour, religion, gender\nidentity, sexual orientation, physical or mental illness or disability must be\navoided unless genuinely relevant to the story.\nFindings of the Committee\n9. While the\njournalist denied that the complainant had quoted the terms of the Editors’ Code\nin requesting that he desist from taking photographs, he said that he did stop\ntaking photographs once the complainant’s partner asked him to. The final two\nphotographs taken did suggest that the complainant’s partner had made a request\nto the journalist, while the roll provided by the newspaper indicated that no\nfurther images were taken; the complainant also provided a photograph of the\njournalist walking away from him and his partner. In such circumstances, the\nCommittee was satisfied that the newspaper had not failed to respect the\ncomplainant’s partner’s request to desist. In addition, there was no evidence\nto suggest that the journalist had visited the complainant’s property. There\nwas no breach of Clause 3 on either point. \n10. The newspaper had provided shorthand notes from the\ncomplainant’s court appearance on 21 June, which demonstrated that it had been\nsaid in court that the box contained underwear. The first article had reported,\nas per the charge, that it had been alleged that the complainant had kicked his\npartner and seized her by the neck; however, when these charges were dropped,\nthis was reported by the newspaper. There was no breach of Clause 1 on either\npoint.\n11. The fourth article reported that the complainant pleaded\nguilty to assault, but was silent on the menacing letter charge that had\npreviously been reported. In such circumstances, the Committee did not consider\nthat the failure to confirm the charges had been dropped gave a significantly\nmisleading impression. There was no breach of Clause 1.\n12. As the complainant did not explain why the other clauses\nhe complained under had been breached, the Committee did not consider his\ncomplaint under those clauses.\nConclusions\n13. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial Action Required\nN/A\nDate complaint received: 21/016/2016\nDate decision issued: 8/11/2016\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
