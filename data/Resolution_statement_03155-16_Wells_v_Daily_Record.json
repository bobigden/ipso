The article had included her maiden name and photograph.\n3. The newspaper said\nthat it was sorry that the article had caused the complainant concern, but it\nconsidered that she was genuinely relevant to the story. Nevertheless, it\nremoved her name and photograph from the article.   \nRelevant Code provisions\n4. Clause 2\n(Privacy)\ni) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private\nand family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital\ncommunications.\nii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual's private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant's own public disclosures of information.\nClause 4 (Intrusion into grief or shock)\nIn cases involving personal grief or shock, enquiries and\napproaches must be made with sympathy and discretion and publication handled\nsensitively. These provisions should not restrict the right to report legal\nproceedings.\nClause 9 (Reporting of crime)\ni) Relatives or friends of persons convicted or accused of\ncrime should not generally be identified without their consent, unless they are\ngenuinely relevant to the story. \nMediated outcome\n5.

The newspaper\noffered to write a private letter of apology to the complainant.\n7. The complainant\nsaid that the letter would resolve the matter to her satisfaction.\n8.
