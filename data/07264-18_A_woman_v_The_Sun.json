It reported that the court had heard that the complainant\nhad undertaken a “campaign of abuse” against the man and his wife; it stated that\nthe complainant “even accused him of rape, putting him through months of worry\nbefore the allegation was finally dropped earlier this year”. A photograph of\nthe complainant, taken outside of court, accompanied the article. 3.   \nThe\ncomplainant said that she had been identified as a victim of sexual assault, in\nbreach of Clause 11. She said that naming her, publishing her photograph and\ndisclosing the area in which she lived had breached her privacy. The\ncomplainant said that the article had implied, inaccurately, that it was she\nwho had dropped the allegation of rape. The complainant acknowledged that\nshortly before her trial, the police had informed her that they were not going\nto proceed against the man in relation to the rape allegation, but said that\nthis was solely because there was no independent evidence available to prove or\ndisprove the allegation. She said that at the time the article was published,\nshe was engaged in a Victim’s Right to Review process and had therefore not\nwithdrawn any part of her complaint. 4.   \nThe newspaper denied any breach of the Code. It said that the\narticle was an accurate report of court proceedings which did not relate to an\naccused being tried for an offence of sexual assault. Given this, the newspaper\nsaid that it was legally free under the Sexual Offences (Amendment) Act 1992,\nto identify the complainant. The newspaper further said that the rape allegation\nhad formed part of the prosecution’s case against the complainant, as heard in\nopen court. The newspaper noted that the complainant had asked the judge to\ngrant an order which would prevent the reporting of her name, but that the\njudge had declined to do so. 5.   \nThe newspaper said that the article had accurately reported the\nprosecution’s case. It said that the article had not specified who had\n“dropped” the rape allegation. It said that, in any event, the article had\naccurately reported what was heard in court. The newspaper provided the copy\nwhich had been filed by the agency: The\nrape allegation was made to police on 21 February, the day after the harassment\nbegan, and in early April she said she wanted it dropped. But on the day she\nwas charged with stalking she stated she wanted the investigation reopened and\nit was only in July this year police finally dropped the rape matter. \nRelevant\nCode provisions 6. Clause 1 (Accuracy) i) The Press must take care not to publish inaccurate, misleading\nor distorted information or images, including headlines not supported by the\ntext. ii) A significant inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion\nmust be corrected, promptly and with due prominence, and- where appropriate- an\napology published. In cases involving IPSO, due prominence should be as\nrequired by the regulator.  \nClause 2 (Privacy) * i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and\nfamily life, home, health and correspondence, including digital communications. ii) Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any\nindividual’s private life without consent. Account will be taken of the\ncomplainant’s own public disclosures of information. iii) It is unacceptable to photograph individuals, without their\nconsent, in public or private places where there is a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy. \nClause 11 (Victims of sexual assault) The press must not identify victims of sexual assault or publish\nmaterial likely to contribute to such identification unless there is adequate\njustification and they are legally free to do so. \nFindings of the Committee 7.   \nThe Committee acknowledged the\ncomplainant’s position that she was a victim of sexual assault and therefore\nshould not have been identified in the article. Under Clause 11 of the Code,\nvictims of sexual assault may only be identified by publications in\ncircumstances where there is adequate justification and they are legally free\nto do so. In law, and under the Code, victims of sexual assault are granted\nanonymity in reports of criminal proceedings which are brought against a\ndefendant for alleged sexual offences. 8.   \nHowever, the law allows victims of sexual assault to be identified\nin legal proceedings in which a defendant is not being tried for an offence of\nsexual assault, but with which the victim is involved. The Committee was\nsatisfied that on the facts of this case, the publication was, as is required\nunder the terms of Clause 11, legally free to name the complainant. The Committee acknowledged the\nimportance of the principle of open justice which ordinarily allows the press\nto identify the parties to legal proceedings, unless precluded by law.  The article\nwas a report of court proceedings in which the complainant was on trial charged\nwith harassment; part of the prosecution’s case against her was the allegation\nof sexual assault which she had made against the man. There was a public\ninterest in reporting what was heard in court in respect of the complainant’s\ntrial in an open and transparent way. The Committee noted that no reporting\nrestriction had been imposed which prevented the complainant being identified,\ndespite the complainant’s request. In these particular circumstances, the\npublication was justified in naming the complainant in the article and\nincluding the information that she had made an allegation that she was the\nvictim of sexual assault. There was no breach of Clause 11. 9.   \nThe published photograph disclosed only the complainant’s\nlikeness, as she had appeared outside of court. No private information was\nrevealed about the complainant. There was no breach of Clause 2. 10.   \nThe article had not specified who had “dropped” the\nallegation of rape in the months preceding the complainant’s trial. In any\nevent, it was accepted that at the time the complainant’s trial had begun, the\npolice had decided not to proceed against the man. In those circumstances, the\narticle did not misrepresent the status of the allegation at the time of the\ncomplainant’s trial. There was no breach of Clause 1. \nConclusions 11.\nThe complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial\nAction Required 12. N/ADate complaint received: 08/11/2018Date decision issued: 12/04/2019\n \nIndependent Complaints Reviewer \nThe complainant complained to the Independent Complaints Reviewer\nabout the process followed by IPSO in handling this complaint. The Independent\nComplaints Reviewer decided that the process was not flawed and did not uphold\nthe request for review.\nBack to ruling listing\n\n\n"
