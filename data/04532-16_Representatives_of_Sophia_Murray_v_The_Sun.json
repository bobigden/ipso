Representatives\nof Sophia Murray complained to the Independent Press Standards Organisation\nthat The Sun breached Clause 2 (Privacy), Clause 3 (Harassment) and Clause 6\n(Children) of the Editors’ Code of Practice in an article headlined “Andy Baby\nShow”, published on 29 June 2016, and in an article headlined “One Love Kim\nMurray stuns as she takes daughter Sophie out to experience her first Wimbledon\nwhile dad Andy stars on Centre Court”, published online on 28 June 2016.\n2. The article\nreported that Andy and Kim Murray’s four-month-old daughter, the complainant,\nhad attended the Wimbledon tennis tournament for the first time. It was\naccompanied by an image of the complainant being pushed in the pram by her\nmother. The top of the complainant’s head was visible in the image, but\noccupied a relatively small portion of the frame. The words “Andy baby show”\nwere accompanied by an arrow pointing at the complainant’s head.\n3. The online\nversion of the article contained two additional images of the complainant being\npushed in her pram. In one of the additional images, the complainant’s mother\nwas pushing the pram, but the complainant was not visible apart from her foot.\nIn the other additional image, only the complainant’s feet and forehead were\nvisible.\n4. The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that the taking of a photographs of the\ncomplainant in a pram, without the knowledge or consent of her parents, and\npublication of the photographs in a national newspaper, was an intrusion into\nthe complainant’s private and family life. They said that Mrs Murray was\nattending Wimbledon to support her husband, and that in order for her to most\nappropriately care for the complainant, as a nursing mother, she needed to take\nher young daughter with her.  The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that the newspaper’s actions interfered with\nthe complainant’s right to be cared for in the manner deemed most appropriate\nby her parents, without being subject to photography, and that as a consequence\nof the photograph being published, arrangements were made for the complainant\nto be looked after at home, which disrupted her feeding arrangements.\n5. The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that images of the complainant have not been\nreleased by her parents, who had previously made it clear to the newspaper that\ntheir clients objected to photographs of the complainant being taken and\npublished. \n6. The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that the dissemination of a child’s\notherwise unpublished image, against the express wishes of her parents, was\nlikely to cause harm and distress. In addition, they said that publication of\nsuch material creates a market for intrusive photographs of their client, and\nencourages harassing conduct by paparazzi photographers. They said that when\nthe complainant and her mother arrived and left Wimbledon that day, they were\njostled and pushed by a group of unknown photographers. They said that in these\ncircumstances, the taking and publication of the photographs constituted\nharassment.\n7. The newspaper\nsaid that the complainant had entered into a public area of the most famous\ntennis venue in the world via Gate 16, a non-ticket holder’s entrance, close to\nthe media centre. It said that the complainant’s mother had been photographed\nentering via Gate 16 in previous years. \nThe newspaper said that the complainant was not identifiable in the\nphotographs it published, and said that there was nothing private about taking\na child through a public area to a crèche. The newspaper noted that the\nWimbledon conditions of entry state that during the tournament, photography\ntakes place in the Grounds, and that “by your presence at The Championships,\nyou grant your permission, free of charge, for your image …to be included in\npictures”.\n8. The newspaper\nsaid that the photographer who took the photograph was accredited to the\nWimbledon Tournament. It said that it was unaware that the complainant was\ngoing to a crèche, and that the photographer had no prior knowledge of the\ncomplainant’s arrival. It said that during the incident, the photographer was\nworking at a distance from the complainant and her mother, and did not follow\nthem or impede their progress. The newspaper denied that any journalist working\nfor, or on behalf of the newspaper had harassed the complainant. \n9. The\ncomplainant’s representatives said that before the photograph was taken, and in\nresponse to Kim Murray’s concern that her daughter not be photographed,\nWimbledon had specifically suggested that they use Gate 16 as it would be quiet\nand free from problems. The complainant’s representatives said that Gate 16 is\ndescribed by Wimbledon as a “private and contractors” entrance, and said that\nthe photographer was not in an approved position.\nRelevant Code Provisions\n10. Clause 2 (Privacy)i) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life,\nhome, health and correspondence, including digital communications.\nii) Editors\nwill be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without\nconsent.

Whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of\nprivacy is highly sensitive to the facts of a case. In this instance, the\ncomplainant was a very young child. She could not be described as a public\nfigure, and neither had her parents sought publicity for her. In addition, she\nwas, at the time she was photographed, being taken by her mother, in a pram, to\nthe Wimbledon crèche. The complainant’s representatives explained that, as a\nconsequence of the publication of the photographs under complaint, the\ncomplainant’s mother had made the decision that those childcare arrangements\nhad to be changed. All these factors supported the complainant’s\nrepresentative’s position that the complainant had enjoyed a reasonable\nexpectation of privacy in relation to the taking and publication of the\nphotographs.\n12. At the same time, the complainant was being taken by her\nmother through a press entrance to Wimbledon; a major sporting event where\nthere would inevitably be a very large number of spectators, and photographers.\nWhile the gate used by the complainant was not a ticket-holders’ entrance, it\nwas accepted that it was a public location, and it appeared that photographers\nwere allowed to stand in a position overlooking the gate. Photographers had\ntaken photographs of the complainant’s mother entering via this gate in\nprevious years. There was no suggestion that the photographer had targeted, or\nsought-out the complainant.\n13. At the time of the photography, the complainant was\nsimply being pushed in a pram, and while the Committee accepted that this\nshowed her engaged in a family activity relating to her care, that activity was\nrelatively unremarkable. Furthermore, as a result of the complainant’s age, and\nthe fact that her face was only partially visible, the Committee did not\nconsider that the complainant was recognisable from the photographs published\nby the newspaper, or that they disclosed any identifying or private information\nabout her.\n14. Having regard for all these factors, the Committee\nconcluded that the nature of the photographs and circumstances and location in\nwhich they were taken meant that the complainant did not, at that time, enjoy a\nreasonable expectation of privacy. As such, neither the taking nor publication\nof the photographs breached Clause 2. The Committee emphasised that this\nfinding was highly specific to the circumstances of this case, and particularly\nthe fact these photographs were taken within the grounds of Wimbledon during\nThe Championships.\n15. The photographs subject to this complaint were taken\nwithout the knowledge of the complainant’s mother, and there was therefore no\nsuggestion that the photographer had continued to photograph the complainant\nafter being asked to desist, or that the photographer’s behaviour had otherwise\nharassed the complainant.\n16. The Committee did not consider that the act of\npublication of the photographs, in the circumstances, constituted harassment\nunder the terms of Clause 3.  Clause 3\ngenerally relates to the conduct of journalists in the news gathering process.\nPublication of information would only represent a course of conduct such as to\nrepresent harassment under the terms of Clause 3 in exceptional circumstances.\nThe Committee did not consider that the newspaper’s publication of the\nphotographs was such a case, and this aspect of the complaint did not raise a\nbreach of Clause 3.\n17. The information the photographs contained about the\ncomplainant, her arrival at Wimbledon, or being pushed in a pram on her way to\nthe Wimbledon crèche were not issues involving her welfare, such that consent\nfor the photographs from a parent was required under Clause 6 (iii). The\nCommittee did not establish that the newspaper had published details of the\ncomplainant’s private life, such as to require justification. As such, there\nwas no breach of Clause 6 (v). There was no breach of Clause 6.\nConclusions\n18. The complaint was not upheld. \nRemedial action required\n19.
